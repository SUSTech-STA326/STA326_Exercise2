P-MapNet: Far-seeing Map Generator Enhanced by both SDMap and HDMap  Priors,"Zhou Jiang, Zhenxin Zhu, Pengfei Li, Huan-ang Gao, Tianyuan Yuan, Yongliang Shi, Hang Zhao, Hao Zhao",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Autonomous vehicles are gradually entering city roads today, with the help of high-definition maps (HDMaps). However, the reliance on HDMaps prevents autonomous vehicles from stepping into regions without this expensive digital infrastructure. This fact drives many researchers to study online HDMap generation algorithms, but the performance of these algorithms at far regions is still unsatisfying. We present P-MapNet, in which the letter P highlights the fact that we focus on incorporating map priors to improve model performance. Specifically, we exploit priors in both SDMap and HDMap. On one hand, we extract weakly aligned SDMap from OpenStreetMap, and encode it as an additional conditioning branch. Despite the misalignment challenge, our attention-based architecture adaptively attends to relevant SDMap skeletons and significantly improves performance. On the other hand, we exploit a masked autoencoder to capture the prior distribution of HDMap, which can serve as a refinement module to mitigate occlusions and artifacts. We benchmark on the nuScenes and Argoverse2 datasets. Through comprehensive experiments, we show that: (1) our SDMap prior can improve online map generation performance, using both rasterized (by up to $+18.73$ $\rm mIoU$) and vectorized (by up to $+8.50$ $\rm mAP$) output representations. (2) our HDMap prior can improve map perceptual metrics by up to $6.34\%$. (3) P-MapNet can be switched into different inference modes that covers different regions of the accuracy-efficiency trade-off landscape. (4) P-MapNet is a far-seeing solution that brings larger improvements on longer ranges. Codes and models are publicly available at this https URL.    "
Strong and Controllable Blind Image Decomposition,"Zeyu Zhang, Junlin Han, Chenhui Gou, Hongdong Li, Liang Zheng",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Image and Video Processing (eess.IV),"Blind image decomposition aims to decompose all components present in an image, typically used to restore a multi-degraded input image. While fully recovering the clean image is appealing, in some scenarios, users might want to retain certain degradations, such as watermarks, for copyright protection. To address this need, we add controllability to the blind image decomposition process, allowing users to enter which types of degradation to remove or retain. We design an architecture named controllable blind image decomposition network. Inserted in the middle of U-Net structure, our method first decomposes the input feature maps and then recombines them according to user instructions. Advantageously, this functionality is implemented at minimal computational cost: decomposition and recombination are all parameter-free. Experimentally, our system excels in blind image decomposition tasks and can outputs partially or fully restored images that well reflect user intentions. Furthermore, we evaluate and configure different options for the network structure and loss functions. This, combined with the proposed decomposition-and-recombination method, yields an efficient and competitive system for blind image decomposition, compared with current state-of-the-art methods.    "
Frozen Feature Augmentation for Few-Shot Image Classification,"Andreas BÃ¤r, Neil Houlsby, Mostafa Dehghani, Manoj Kumar",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Training a linear classifier or lightweight model on top of pretrained vision model outputs, so-called 'frozen features', leads to impressive performance on a number of downstream few-shot tasks. Currently, frozen features are not modified during training. On the other hand, when networks are trained directly on images, data augmentation is a standard recipe that improves performance with no substantial overhead. In this paper, we conduct an extensive pilot study on few-shot image classification that explores applying data augmentations in the frozen feature space, dubbed 'frozen feature augmentation (FroFA)', covering twenty augmentations in total. Our study demonstrates that adopting a deceptively simple pointwise FroFA, such as brightness, can improve few-shot performance consistently across three network architectures, three large pretraining datasets, and eight transfer datasets.

Lodge: A Coarse to Fine Diffusion Network for Long Dance Generation  Guided by the Characteristic Dance Primitives,"Ronghui Li, YuXiang Zhang, Yachao Zhang, Hongwen Zhang, Jie Guo, Yan Zhang, Yebin Liu, Xiu Li",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Graphics (cs.GR); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS),"We propose Lodge, a network capable of generating extremely long dance sequences conditioned on given music. We design Lodge as a two-stage coarse to fine diffusion architecture, and propose the characteristic dance primitives that possess significant expressiveness as intermediate representations between two diffusion models. The first stage is global diffusion, which focuses on comprehending the coarse-level music-dance correlation and production characteristic dance primitives. In contrast, the second-stage is the local diffusion, which parallelly generates detailed motion sequences under the guidance of the dance primitives and choreographic rules. In addition, we propose a Foot Refine Block to optimize the contact between the feet and the ground, enhancing the physical realism of the motion. Our approach can parallelly generate dance sequences of extremely long length, striking a balance between global choreographic patterns and local motion quality and expressiveness. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our method.    "
VideoAgent: Long-form Video Understanding with Large Language Model as  Agent,"Xiaohan Wang, Yuhui Zhang, Orr Zohar, Serena Yeung-Levy",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Information Retrieval (cs.IR),"Long-form video understanding represents a significant challenge within computer vision, demanding a model capable of reasoning over long multi-modal sequences. Motivated by the human cognitive process for long-form video understanding, we emphasize interactive reasoning and planning over the ability to process lengthy visual inputs. We introduce a novel agent-based system, VideoAgent, that employs a large language model as a central agent to iteratively identify and compile crucial information to answer a question, with vision-language foundation models serving as tools to translate and retrieve visual information. Evaluated on the challenging EgoSchema and NExT-QA benchmarks, VideoAgent achieves 54.1% and 71.3% zero-shot accuracy with only 8.4 and 8.2 frames used on average. These results demonstrate superior effectiveness and efficiency of our method over the current state-of-the-art methods, highlighting the potential of agent-based approaches in advancing long-form video understanding.

FeatUp: A Model-Agnostic Framework for Features at Any Resolution,"Stephanie Fu, Mark Hamilton, Laura Brandt, Axel Feldman, Zhoutong Zhang, William T. Freeman",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Information Retrieval (cs.IR); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Deep features are a cornerstone of computer vision research, capturing image semantics and enabling the community to solve downstream tasks even in the zero- or few-shot regime. However, these features often lack the spatial resolution to directly perform dense prediction tasks like segmentation and depth prediction because models aggressively pool information over large areas. In this work, we introduce FeatUp, a task- and model-agnostic framework to restore lost spatial information in deep features. We introduce two variants of FeatUp: one that guides features with high-resolution signal in a single forward pass, and one that fits an implicit model to a single image to reconstruct features at any resolution. Both approaches use a multi-view consistency loss with deep analogies to NeRFs. Our features retain their original semantics and can be swapped into existing applications to yield resolution and performance gains even without re-training. We show that FeatUp significantly outperforms other feature upsampling and image super-resolution approaches in class activation map generation, transfer learning for segmentation and depth prediction, and end-to-end training for semantic segmentation.

Surveyor: Facilitating Discovery Within Video Games for Blind and Low  Vision Players,"Vishnu Nair, Hanxiu 'Hazel' Zhu, Peize Song, Jizhong Wang, Brian A. Smith",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),"Video games are increasingly accessible to blind and low vision (BLV) players, yet many aspects remain inaccessible. One aspect is the joy players feel when they explore environments and make new discoveries, which is integral to many games. Sighted players experience discovery by surveying environments and identifying unexplored areas. Current accessibility tools, however, guide BLV players directly to items and places, robbing them of that experience. Thus, a crucial challenge is to develop navigation assistance tools that also foster exploration and discovery. To address this challenge, we propose the concept of exploration assistance in games and design Surveyor, an in-game exploration assistance tool that enhances discovery by tracking where BLV players look and highlighting unexplored areas. We designed Surveyor using insights from a formative study and compared Surveyor's effectiveness to approaches found in existing accessible games. Our findings reveal implications for facilitating richer play experiences for BLV users within games.    "
A Novel Framework for Multi-Person Temporal Gaze Following and Social  Gaze Prediction,"Anshul Gupta, Samy Tafasca, Arya Farkhondeh, Pierre Vuillecard, Jean-Marc Odobez",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Gaze following and social gaze prediction are fundamental tasks providing insights into human communication behaviors, intent, and social interactions. Most previous approaches addressed these tasks separately, either by designing highly specialized social gaze models that do not generalize to other social gaze tasks or by considering social gaze inference as an ad-hoc post-processing of the gaze following task. Furthermore, the vast majority of gaze following approaches have proposed static models that can handle only one person at a time, therefore failing to take advantage of social interactions and temporal dynamics. In this paper, we address these limitations and introduce a novel framework to jointly predict the gaze target and social gaze label for all people in the scene. The framework comprises of: (i) a temporal, transformer-based architecture that, in addition to image tokens, handles person-specific tokens capturing the gaze information related to each individual; (ii) a new dataset, VSGaze, that unifies annotation types across multiple gaze following and social gaze datasets. We show that our model trained on VSGaze can address all tasks jointly, and achieves state-of-the-art results for multi-person gaze following and social gaze prediction.    "
Demystifying Faulty Code with LLM: Step-by-Step Reasoning for  Explainable Fault Localization,"Ratnadira Widyasari, Jia Wei Ang, Truong Giang Nguyen, Neil Sharma, David Lo",Software Engineering (cs.SE),"Fault localization is a critical process that involves identifying specific program elements responsible for program failures. Manually pinpointing these elements, such as classes, methods, or statements, which are associated with a fault is laborious and time-consuming. To overcome this challenge, various fault localization tools have been developed. These tools typically generate a ranked list of suspicious program elements. However, this information alone is insufficient. A prior study emphasized that automated fault localization should offer a rationale.In this study, we investigate the step-by-step reasoning for explainable fault localization. We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLM) in assisting developers in reasoning about code. We proposed FuseFL that utilizes several combinations of information to enhance the LLM results which are spectrum-based fault localization results, test case execution outcomes, and code description (i.e., explanation of what the given code is intended to do). We conducted our investigation using faulty code from Refactory dataset. First, we evaluate the performance of the automated fault localization. Our results demonstrate a more than 30% increase in the number of successfully localized faults at Top-1 compared to the baseline. To evaluate the explanations generated by FuseFL, we create a dataset of human explanations that provide step-by-step reasoning as to why specific lines of code are considered faulty. This dataset consists of 324 faulty code files, along with explanations for 600 faulty lines. Furthermore, we also conducted human studies to evaluate the explanations. We found that for 22 out of the 30 randomly sampled cases, FuseFL generated correct explanations.    "
HumanoidBench: Simulated Humanoid Benchmark for Whole-Body Locomotion  and Manipulation,"Carmelo Sferrazza, Dun-Ming Huang, Xingyu Lin, Youngwoon Lee, Pieter Abbeel",Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Humanoid robots hold great promise in assisting humans in diverse environments and tasks, due to their flexibility and adaptability leveraging human-like morphology. However, research in humanoid robots is often bottlenecked by the costly and fragile hardware setups. To accelerate algorithmic research in humanoid robots, we present a high-dimensional, simulated robot learning benchmark, HumanoidBench, featuring a humanoid robot equipped with dexterous hands and a variety of challenging whole-body manipulation and locomotion tasks. Our findings reveal that state-of-the-art reinforcement learning algorithms struggle with most tasks, whereas a hierarchical learning baseline achieves superior performance when supported by robust low-level policies, such as walking or reaching. With HumanoidBench, we provide the robotics community with a platform to identify the challenges arising when solving diverse tasks with humanoid robots, facilitating prompt verification of algorithms and ideas.

ATOM: Asynchronous Training of Massive Models for Deep Learning in a  Decentralized Environment,"Xiaofeng Wu, Jia Rao, Wei Chen","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Software Engineering (cs.SE)","The advent of the Transformer architecture has propelled the growth of natural language processing (NLP) models, leading to remarkable achievements in numerous NLP tasks. Yet, the absence of specialized hardware like expansive GPU memory and high-speed interconnects poses challenges for training large-scale models. This makes it daunting for many users to experiment with pre-training and fine-tuning large language models (LLMs). In this study, we introduce \atom, a resilient distributed training framework designed for asynchronous training of vast models in a decentralized setting using cost-effective hardware, including consumer-grade GPUs and Ethernet. Unlike conventional model partitioning methods that distribute sub-models across GPUs, \atom aims to accommodate a complete LLM on one host (peer) through seamlessly model swapping and concurrently trains multiple copies across various peers to optimize training throughput. Through static analysis, \atom identifies the best model partitioning strategy and flawlessly merges model execution with swapping. Key benefits of \atom include: Avoiding the central point of failure found in pipeline parallelism methods. Demonstrating superior performance and scalability compared to closely-integrated pipeline parallelism in slower networks. Our experiments using different GPT-3 model configurations reveal that, in scenarios with suboptimal network connections, \atom can enhance training efficiency up to $20 \times$ when juxtaposed with the state-of-the-art decentralized pipeline parallelism approaches.

Belief Change based on Knowledge Measures,"Umberto Straccia, Giovanni Casini",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Knowledge Measures (KMs) aim at quantifying the amount of knowledge/information that a knowledge base carries. On the other hand, Belief Change (BC) is the process of changing beliefs (in our case, in terms of contraction, expansion and revision) taking into account a new piece of knowledge, which possibly may be in contradiction with the current belief. We propose a new quantitative BC framework that is based on KMs by defining belief change operators that try to minimise, from an information-theoretic point of view, the surprise that the changed belief carries. To this end, we introduce the principle of minimal surprise. In particular, our contributions are (i) a general information-theoretic approach to KMs for which [1] is a special case; (ii) KM-based BC operators that satisfy the so-called AGM postulates; and (iii) a characterisation of any BC operator that satisfies the AGM postulates as a KM-based BC operator, i.e., any BC operator satisfying the AGM postulates can be encoded within our quantitative BC framework. We also introduce quantitative measures that account for the information loss of contraction, information gain of expansion and information change of revision. We also give a succinct look into the problem of iterated revision, which deals with the application of a sequence of revision operations in our framework, and also illustrate how one may build from our KM-based contraction operator also one not satisfying the (in)famous recovery postulate, by focusing on the so-called severe withdrawal model as an illustrative example.

Benchmarking Zero-Shot Robustness of Multimodal Foundation Models: A  Pilot Study,"Chenguang Wang, Ruoxi Jia, Xin Liu, Dawn Song",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Pre-training image representations from the raw text about images enables zero-shot vision transfer to downstream tasks. Through pre-training on millions of samples collected from the internet, multimodal foundation models, such as CLIP, produce state-of-the-art zero-shot results that often reach competitiveness with fully supervised methods without the need for task-specific training. Besides the encouraging performance on classification accuracy, it is reported that these models close the robustness gap by matching the performance of supervised models trained on ImageNet under natural distribution shift. Because robustness is critical to real-world applications, especially safety-critical ones, in this paper, we present a comprehensive evaluation based on a large-scale robustness benchmark covering 7 natural, 3 synthetic distribution shifts, and 11 adversarial attacks. We use CLIP as a pilot study. We show that CLIP leads to a significant robustness drop compared to supervised ImageNet models on our benchmark, especially under synthetic distribution shift and adversarial attacks. Furthermore, data overlap analysis suggests that the observed robustness under natural distribution shifts could be attributed, at least in part, to data overlap. In summary, our evaluation shows a comprehensive evaluation of robustness is necessary; and there is a significant need to improve the robustness of zero-shot multimodal models.    "
Data-Driven Distributionally Robust Safety Verification Using Barrier  Certificates and Conditional Mean Embeddings,"Oliver SchÃ¶n, Zhengang Zhong, Sadegh Soudjani",Systems and Control (eess.SY); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Algorithmic verification of realistic systems to satisfy safety and other temporal requirements has suffered from poor scalability of the employed formal approaches. To design systems with rigorous guarantees, many approaches still rely on exact models of the underlying systems. Since this assumption can rarely be met in practice, models have to be inferred from measurement data or are bypassed completely. Whilst former usually requires the model structure to be known a-priori and immense amounts of data to be available, latter gives rise to a plethora of restrictive mathematical assumptions about the unknown dynamics. In a pursuit of developing scalable formal verification algorithms without shifting the problem to unrealistic assumptions, we employ the concept of barrier certificates, which can guarantee safety of the system, and learn the certificate directly from a compact set of system trajectories. We use conditional mean embeddings to embed data from the system into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) and construct an RKHS ambiguity set that can be inflated to robustify the result w.r.t. a set of plausible transition kernels. We show how to solve the resulting program efficiently using sum-of-squares optimization and a Gaussian process envelope. Our approach lifts the need for restrictive assumptions on the system dynamics and uncertainty, and suggests an improvement in the sample complexity of verifying the safety of a system on a tested case study compared to a state-of-the-art approach.

Reconfigurable Robot Identification from Motion Data,"Yuhang Hu, Yunzhe Wang, Ruibo Liu, Zhou Shen, Hod Lipson",Robotics (cs.RO),"Integrating Large Language Models (VLMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) with robotic systems enables robots to process and understand complex natural language instructions and visual information. However, a fundamental challenge remains: for robots to fully capitalize on these advancements, they must have a deep understanding of their physical embodiment. The gap between AI models cognitive capabilities and the understanding of physical embodiment leads to the following question: Can a robot autonomously understand and adapt to its physical form and functionalities through interaction with its environment? This question underscores the transition towards developing self-modeling robots without reliance on external sensory or pre-programmed knowledge about their structure. Here, we propose a meta self modeling that can deduce robot morphology through proprioception (the internal sense of position and movement). Our study introduces a 12 DoF reconfigurable legged robot, accompanied by a diverse dataset of 200k unique configurations, to systematically investigate the relationship between robotic motion and robot morphology. Utilizing a deep neural network model comprising a robot signature encoder and a configuration decoder, we demonstrate the capability of our system to accurately predict robot configurations from proprioceptive signals. This research contributes to the field of robotic self-modeling, aiming to enhance understanding of their physical embodiment and adaptability in real world scenarios.    "
Lifelong LERF: Local 3D Semantic Inventory Monitoring Using FogROS2,"Adam Rashid, Chung Min Kim, Justin Kerr, Letian Fu, Kush Hari, Ayah Ahmad, Kaiyuan Chen, Huang Huang, Marcus Gualtieri, Michael Wang, Christian Juette, Nan Tian, Liu Ren, Ken Goldberg",Robotics (cs.RO),"Inventory monitoring in homes, factories, and retail stores relies on maintaining data despite objects being swapped, added, removed, or moved. We introduce Lifelong LERF, a method that allows a mobile robot with minimal compute to jointly optimize a dense language and geometric representation of its surroundings. Lifelong LERF maintains this representation over time by detecting semantic changes and selectively updating these regions of the environment, avoiding the need to exhaustively remap. Human users can query inventory by providing natural language queries and receiving a 3D heatmap of potential object locations. To manage the computational load, we use Fog-ROS2, a cloud robotics platform, to offload resource-intensive tasks. Lifelong LERF obtains poses from a monocular RGBD SLAM backend, and uses these poses to progressively optimize a Language Embedded Radiance Field (LERF) for semantic monitoring. Experiments with 3-5 objects arranged on a tabletop and a Turtlebot with a RealSense camera suggest that Lifelong LERF can persistently adapt to changes in objects with up to 91% accuracy.    "
MusicHiFi: Fast High-Fidelity Stereo Vocoding,"Ge Zhu, Juan-Pablo Caceres, Zhiyao Duan, Nicholas J. Bryan",Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS); Signal Processing (eess.SP),"Diffusion-based audio and music generation models commonly generate music by constructing an image representation of audio (e.g., a mel-spectrogram) and then converting it to audio using a phase reconstruction model or vocoder. Typical vocoders, however, produce monophonic audio at lower resolutions (e.g., 16-24 kHz), which limits their effectiveness. We propose MusicHiFi -- an efficient high-fidelity stereophonic vocoder. Our method employs a cascade of three generative adversarial networks (GANs) that convert low-resolution mel-spectrograms to audio, upsamples to high-resolution audio via bandwidth expansion, and upmixes to stereophonic audio. Compared to previous work, we propose 1) a unified GAN-based generator and discriminator architecture and training procedure for each stage of our cascade, 2) a new fast, near downsampling-compatible bandwidth extension module, and 3) a new fast downmix-compatible mono-to-stereo upmixer that ensures the preservation of monophonic content in the output. We evaluate our approach using both objective and subjective listening tests and find our approach yields comparable or better audio quality, better spatialization control, and significantly faster inference speed compared to past work.

Mitigating Dialogue Hallucination for Large Multi-modal Models via  Adversarial Instruction Tuning,"Dongmin Park, Zhaofang Qian, Guangxing Han, Ser-Nam Lim",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Mitigating hallucinations of Large Multi-modal Models(LMMs) is crucial to enhance their reliability for general-purpose assistants. This paper shows that such hallucinations of LMMs can be significantly exacerbated by preceding user-system dialogues. To precisely measure this, we first present an evaluation benchmark by extending popular multi-modal benchmark datasets with prepended hallucinatory dialogues generated by our novel Adversarial Question Generator, which can automatically generate image-related yet adversarial dialogues by adopting adversarial attacks on LMMs. On our benchmark, the zero-shot performance of state-of-the-art LMMs dropped significantly for both the VQA and Captioning tasks. Next, we further reveal this hallucination is mainly due to the prediction bias toward preceding dialogues rather than visual content. To reduce this bias, we propose Adversarial Instruction Tuning that robustly fine-tunes LMMs on augmented multi-modal instruction-following datasets with hallucinatory dialogues. Extensive experiments show that our proposed approach successfully reduces dialogue hallucination while maintaining or even improving performance.    "
Joint Multimodal Transformer for Dimensional Emotional Recognition in  the Wild,"Paul Waligora, Osama Zeeshan, Haseeb Aslam, Soufiane Belharbi, Alessandro Lameiras Koerich, Marco Pedersoli, Simon Bacon, Eric Granger",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS),"Audiovisual emotion recognition (ER) in videos has immense potential over unimodal performance. It effectively leverages the inter- and intra-modal dependencies between visual and auditory modalities. This work proposes a novel audio-visual emotion recognition system utilizing a joint multimodal transformer architecture with key-based cross-attention. This framework aims to exploit the complementary nature of audio and visual cues (facial expressions and vocal patterns) in videos, leading to superior performance compared to solely relying on a single modality. The proposed model leverages separate backbones for capturing intra-modal temporal dependencies within each modality (audio and visual). Subsequently, a joint multimodal transformer architecture integrates the individual modality embeddings, enabling the model to effectively capture inter-modal (between audio and visual) and intra-modal (within each modality) relationships. Extensive evaluations on the challenging Affwild2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms baseline and state-of-the-art methods in ER tasks.    "
Stimulate the Potential of Robots via Competition,"Kangyao Huang, Di Guo, Xinyu Zhang, Xiangyang Ji, Huaping Liu",Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"It is common for us to feel pressure in a competition environment, which arises from the desire to obtain success comparing with other individuals or opponents. Although we might get anxious under the pressure, it could also be a drive for us to stimulate our potentials to the best in order to keep up with others. Inspired by this, we propose a competitive learning framework which is able to help individual robot to acquire knowledge from the competition, fully stimulating its dynamics potential in the race. Specifically, the competition information among competitors is introduced as the additional auxiliary signal to learn advantaged actions. We further build a Multiagent-Race environment, and extensive experiments are conducted, demonstrating that robots trained in competitive environments outperform ones that are trained with SoTA algorithms in single robot environment.

Moodle Usability Assessment Methodology using the Universal Design for  Learning perspective,"Rosana Montes, Liliana Herrera, Emilio Crisol",Computers and Society (cs.CY),"The application of the Universal Design for Learning framework favors the creation of virtual educational environments for all. It requires developing accessible content, having a usable platform, and the use of flexible didactics and evaluations that promote constant student motivation. The present study aims to design a methodology to evaluate the usability of the Moodle platform based on the principles of Universal Design for Learning, recognizing the importance of accessibility, usability and the availability of Assistive Technologies. We developed and applied a methodology to assess the usability level of Moodle platforms, taking into consideration that they integrate Assistive Technologies or are used for MOOC contexts.

We employed the framework of mixed design research in order to assess a MOOC-type educational program devised under the principles of Universal Design for Learning. As a result of the assessment of Moodle v.2.x and v.3.x, we conclude that the platforms must improve some key elements (e.g. contrasting colors, incorporation of alternative text and links) in order to comply with international accessibility standards. With respect to usability, we can confirm that the principles and guidelines of Universal Design for Learning are applicable to MOOC-type Virtual Learning Environments, are positively valued by students, and have a positive impact on certification rates.

Complete equational theories for classical and quantum Gaussian  relations,"Robert I.

Approximate Nullspace Augmented Finetuning for Robust Vision  Transformers,"Haoyang Liu, Aditya Singh, Yijiang Li, Haohan Wang",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Enhancing the robustness of deep learning models, particularly in the realm of vision transformers (ViTs), is crucial for their real-world deployment. In this work, we provide a finetuning approach to enhance the robustness of vision transformers inspired by the concept of nullspace from linear algebra. Our investigation centers on whether a vision transformer can exhibit resilience to input variations akin to the nullspace property in linear mappings, implying that perturbations sampled from this nullspace do not influence the model's output when added to the input. Firstly, we show that for many pretrained ViTs, a non-trivial nullspace exists due to the presence of the patch embedding layer. Secondly, as nullspace is a concept associated with linear algebra, we demonstrate that it is possible to synthesize approximate nullspace elements for the non-linear blocks of ViTs employing an optimisation strategy. Finally, we propose a fine-tuning strategy for ViTs wherein we augment the training data with synthesized approximate nullspace noise. After finetuning, we find that the model demonstrates robustness to adversarial and natural image perbutations alike.    "
An Empirical Study on Developers Shared Conversations with ChatGPT in  GitHub Pull Requests and Issues,"Huizi Hao, Kazi Amit Hasan, Hong Qin, Marcos Macedo, Yuan Tian, Steven H. H. Ding, Ahmed E. Hassan",Software Engineering (cs.SE),"ChatGPT has significantly impacted software development practices, providing substantial assistance to developers in a variety of tasks, including coding, testing, and debugging. Despite its widespread adoption, the impact of ChatGPT as an assistant in collaborative coding remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we analyze a dataset of 210 and 370 developers shared conversations with ChatGPT in GitHub pull requests (PRs) and issues. We manually examined the content of the conversations and characterized the dynamics of the sharing behavior, i.e., understanding the rationale behind the sharing, identifying the locations where the conversations were shared, and determining the roles of the developers who shared them. Our main observations are: (1) Developers seek ChatGPT assistance across 16 types of software engineering inquiries. In both conversations shared in PRs and issues, the most frequently encountered inquiry categories include code generation, conceptual questions, how-to guides, issue resolution, and code review. (2) Developers frequently engage with ChatGPT via multi-turn conversations where each prompt can fulfill various roles, such as unveiling initial or new tasks, iterative follow-up, and prompt refinement. Multi-turn conversations account for 33.2% of the conversations shared in PRs and 36.9% in issues. (3) In collaborative coding, developers leverage shared conversations with ChatGPT to facilitate their role-specific contributions, whether as authors of PRs or issues, code reviewers, or collaborators on issues.

Safety Cases: Justifying the Safety of Advanced AI Systems,"Joshua Clymer, Nick Gabrieli, David Krueger, Thomas Larsen",Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"As AI systems become more advanced, companies and regulators will make difficult decisions about whether it is safe to train and deploy them. To prepare for these decisions, we investigate how developers could make a 'safety case,' which is a structured rationale that AI systems are unlikely to cause a catastrophe. We propose a framework for organizing a safety case and discuss four categories of arguments to justify safety: total inability to cause a catastrophe, sufficiently strong control measures, trustworthiness despite capability to cause harm, and deference to credible AI advisors. We evaluate concrete examples of arguments in each category and outline how arguments could be combined to justify that AI systems are safe to deploy.    "
Introducing Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT) to Enhance  ML Robustness,"Mohamed elShehaby, Aditya Kotha, Ashraf Matrawy",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),"Machine Learning (ML) is susceptible to adversarial attacks that aim to trick ML models, making them produce faulty predictions. Adversarial training was found to increase the robustness of ML models against these attacks. However, in network and cybersecurity, obtaining labeled training and adversarial training data is challenging and costly. Furthermore, concept drift deepens the challenge, particularly in dynamic domains like network and cybersecurity, and requires various models to conduct periodic retraining. This letter introduces Adaptive Continuous Adversarial Training (ACAT) to continuously integrate adversarial training samples into the model during ongoing learning sessions, using real-world detected adversarial data, to enhance model resilience against evolving adversarial threats. ACAT is an adaptive defense mechanism that utilizes periodic retraining to effectively counter adversarial attacks while mitigating catastrophic forgetting. Our approach also reduces the total time required for adversarial sample detection, especially in environments such as network security where the rate of attacks could be very high. Traditional detection processes that involve two stages may result in lengthy procedures. Experimental results using a SPAM detection dataset demonstrate that with ACAT, the accuracy of the SPAM filter increased from 69% to over 88% after just three retraining sessions. Furthermore, ACAT outperforms conventional adversarial sample detectors, providing faster decision times, up to four times faster in some cases.    "
Online Concurrent Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning,"Ratijit Mitra, Indranil Saha",Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Recently, centralized receding horizon online multi-robot coverage path planning algorithms have shown remarkable scalability in thoroughly exploring large, complex, unknown workspaces with many robots. In a horizon, the path planning and the path execution interleave, meaning when the path planning occurs for robots with no paths, the robots with outstanding paths do not execute, and subsequently, when the robots with new or outstanding paths execute to reach respective goals, path planning does not occur for those robots yet to get new paths, leading to wastage of both the robotic and the computation resources. As a remedy, we propose a centralized algorithm that is not horizon-based. It plans paths at any time for a subset of robots with no paths, i.e., who have reached their previously assigned goals, while the rest execute their outstanding paths, thereby enabling concurrent planning and execution. We formally prove that the proposed algorithm ensures complete coverage of an unknown workspace and analyze its time complexity. To demonstrate scalability, we evaluate our algorithm to cover eight large $2$D grid benchmark workspaces with up to 512 aerial and ground robots, respectively. A comparison with a state-of-the-art horizon-based algorithm shows its superiority in completing the coverage with up to 1.6x speedup. For validation, we perform ROS + Gazebo simulations in six 2D grid benchmark workspaces with 10 quadcopters and TurtleBots, respectively. We also successfully conducted one outdoor experiment with three quadcopters and one indoor with two TurtleBots.    "
Understanding the Double Descent Phenomenon in Deep Learning,"Marc Lafon, Alexandre Thomas",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"Combining empirical risk minimization with capacity control is a classical strategy in machine learning when trying to control the generalization gap and avoid overfitting, as the model class capacity gets larger. Yet, in modern deep learning practice, very large over-parameterized models (e.g. neural networks) are optimized to fit perfectly the training data and still obtain great generalization performance. Past the interpolation point, increasing model complexity seems to actually lower the test error.In this tutorial, we explain the concept of double descent and its mechanisms. The first section sets the classical statistical learning framework and introduces the double descent phenomenon. By looking at a number of examples, section 2 introduces inductive biases that appear to have a key role in double descent by selecting, among the multiple interpolating solutions, a smooth empirical risk minimizer. Finally, section 3 explores the double descent with two linear models, and gives other points of view from recent related works.    "
Partially Observable Task and Motion Planning with Uncertainty and Risk  Awareness,"Aidan Curtis, George Matheos, Nishad Gothoskar, Vikash Mansinghka, Joshua Tenenbaum, TomÃ¡s Lozano-PÃ©rez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling",Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Integrated task and motion planning (TAMP) has proven to be a valuable approach to generalizable long-horizon robotic manipulation and navigation problems. However, the typical TAMP problem formulation assumes full observability and deterministic action effects. These assumptions limit the ability of the planner to gather information and make decisions that are risk-aware. We propose a strategy for TAMP with Uncertainty and Risk Awareness (TAMPURA) that is capable of efficiently solving long-horizon planning problems with initial-state and action outcome uncertainty, including problems that require information gathering and avoiding undesirable and irreversible outcomes. Our planner reasons under uncertainty at both the abstract task level and continuous controller level. Given a set of closed-loop goal-conditioned controllers operating in the primitive action space and a description of their preconditions and potential capabilities, we learn a high-level abstraction that can be solved efficiently and then refined to continuous actions for execution. We demonstrate our approach on several robotics problems where uncertainty is a crucial factor and show that reasoning under uncertainty in these problems outperforms previously proposed determinized planning, direct search, and reinforcement learning strategies. Lastly, we demonstrate our planner on two real-world robotics problems using recent advancements in probabilistic perception.    "
Robust Shape Fitting for 3D Scene Abstraction,"Florian Kluger, Eric Brachmann, Michael Ying Yang, Bodo Rosenhahn",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Humans perceive and construct the world as an arrangement of simple parametric models. In particular, we can often describe man-made environments using volumetric primitives such as cuboids or cylinders. Inferring these primitives is important for attaining high-level, abstract scene descriptions. Previous approaches for primitive-based abstraction estimate shape parameters directly and are only able to reproduce simple objects. In contrast, we propose a robust estimator for primitive fitting, which meaningfully abstracts complex real-world environments using cuboids. A RANSAC estimator guided by a neural network fits these primitives to a depth map. We condition the network on previously detected parts of the scene, parsing it one-by-one. To obtain cuboids from single RGB images, we additionally optimise a depth estimation CNN end-to-end. Naively minimising point-to-primitive distances leads to large or spurious cuboids occluding parts of the scene. We thus propose an improved occlusion-aware distance metric correctly handling opaque scenes. Furthermore, we present a neural network based cuboid solver which provides more parsimonious scene abstractions while also reducing inference time. The proposed algorithm does not require labour-intensive labels, such as cuboid annotations, for training. Results on the NYU Depth v2 dataset demonstrate that the proposed algorithm successfully abstracts cluttered real-world 3D scene layouts.    "
Subgame Optimal and Prior-Independent Online Algorithms,"Jason Hartline, Aleck Johnsen, Anant Shah",Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),"This paper takes a game theoretic approach to the design and analysis of online algorithms and illustrates the approach on the finite-horizon ski-rental problem. This approach allows beyond worst-case analysis of online algorithms. First, we define ""subgame optimality"" which is stronger than worst case optimality in that it requires the algorithm to take advantage of an adversary not playing a worst case input. Algorithms only focusing on the worst case can be far from subgame optimal. Second, we consider prior-independent design and analysis of online algorithms, where rather than choosing a worst case input, the adversary chooses a worst case independent and identical distribution over inputs. Prior-independent online algorithms are generally analytically intractable; instead we give a fully polynomial time approximation scheme to compute them. Highlighting the potential improvement from these paradigms for the finite-horizon ski-rental problem, we empirically compare worst-case, subgame optimal, and prior-independent algorithms in the prior-independent framework.

Enhancing LLM Factual Accuracy with RAG to Counter Hallucinations: A  Case Study on Domain-Specific Queries in Private Knowledge-Bases,"Jiarui Li, Ye Yuan, Zehua Zhang",Computation and Language (cs.CL); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"We proposed an end-to-end system design towards utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) to improve the factual accuracy of Large Language Models (LLMs) for domain-specific and time-sensitive queries related to private knowledge-bases. Our system integrates RAG pipeline with upstream datasets processing and downstream performance evaluation. Addressing the challenge of LLM hallucinations, we finetune models with a curated dataset which originates from CMU's extensive resources and annotated with the teacher model. Our experiments demonstrate the system's effectiveness in generating more accurate answers to domain-specific and time-sensitive inquiries. The results also revealed the limitations of fine-tuning LLMs with small-scale and skewed datasets. This research highlights the potential of RAG systems in augmenting LLMs with external datasets for improved performance in knowledge-intensive tasks. Our code and models are available on Github.

Optimal Block-Level Draft Verification for Accelerating Speculative  Decoding,"Ziteng Sun, Jae Hun Ro, Ahmad Beirami, Ananda Theertha Suresh",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Information Theory (cs.IT),"Speculative decoding has shown to be an effective method for lossless acceleration of large language models (LLMs) during inference. In each iteration, the algorithm first uses a smaller model to draft a block of tokens. The tokens are then verified by the large model in parallel and only a subset of tokens will be kept to guarantee that the final output follows the distribution of the large model. In all of the prior speculative decoding works, the draft verification is performed token-by-token independently. In this work, we propose a better draft verification algorithm that provides additional wall-clock speedup without incurring additional computation cost and draft tokens. We first formulate the draft verification step as a block-level optimal transport problem. The block-level formulation allows us to consider a wider range of draft verification algorithms and obtain a higher number of accepted tokens in expectation in one draft block. We propose a verification algorithm that achieves the optimal accepted length for the block-level transport problem. We empirically evaluate our proposed block-level verification algorithm in a wide range of tasks and datasets, and observe consistent improvements in wall-clock speedup when compared to token-level verification algorithm. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first to establish improvement over speculative decoding through a better draft verification algorithm.    "
Data Ethics Emergency Drill: A Toolbox for Discussing Responsible AI for  Industry Teams,"Vanessa Aisyahsari Hanschke, Dylan Rees, Merve Alanyali, David Hopkinson, Paul Marshall",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Researchers urge technology practitioners such as data scientists to consider the impacts and ethical implications of algorithmic decisions. However, unlike programming, statistics, and data management, discussion of ethical implications is rarely included in standard data science training. To begin to address this gap, we designed and tested a toolbox called the data ethics emergency drill (DEED) to help data science teams discuss and reflect on the ethical implications of their work. The DEED is a roleplay of a fictional ethical emergency scenario that is contextually situated in the team's specific workplace and applications. This paper outlines the DEED toolbox and describes three studies carried out with two different data science teams that iteratively shaped its design. Our findings show that practitioners can apply lessons learnt from the roleplay to real-life situations, and how the DEED opened up conversations around ethics and values.    "

On the Use of Cramer-Rao Lower Bound for Least-Variance Circuit  Parameters Identification of Li-ion Cells,"Vladimir Sovljanski, Mario Paolone",Systems and Control (eess.SY),"Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) and Equivalent Circuit Models (ECMs) are widely used to characterize the impedance and estimate parameters of electrochemical systems such as batteries. We use a generic ECM with ten parameters grouped to model different frequency regions of the Li-ion cell's impedance spectrum. We derive a noise covariance matrix from the measurement model and use it to assign weights for the fitting technique. The paper presents two formulations of the parameters identification problem. Using the properties of the ECM EIS spectra, we propose a method to initialize ECM parameters for the Complex Non-linear Least Squares (CNLS) technique. The paper proposes a novel algorithm for designing the EIS experiments by applying the theory on Cramer-Rao Lower Bound (CRLB) and Fisher Information Matrix (FIM) to the identification problem. We show that contributions to the FIM elements strongly depend on the frequencies at which EIS is performed. Hence, the algorithm aims to adjust frequencies such that the most information about parameters is collected. This is done by minimizing the highest variance of ECM parameters defined by CRLB. Results of a numerical experiment show that the estimator is efficient, and frequency adjustment leads to more accurate ECM parameters' identification.    "
Using an LLM to Turn Sign Spottings into Spoken Language Sentences,"Ozge Mercanoglu Sincan, Necati Cihan Camgoz, Richard Bowden",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Sign Language Translation (SLT) is a challenging task that aims to generate spoken language sentences from sign language videos. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid SLT approach, Spotter+GPT, that utilizes a sign spotter and a pretrained large language model to improve SLT performance. Our method builds upon the strengths of both components. The videos are first processed by the spotter, which is trained on a linguistic sign language dataset, to identify individual signs. These spotted signs are then passed to the powerful language model, which transforms them into coherent and contextually appropriate spoken language sentences.    "
AI-enhanced Collective Intelligence: The State of the Art and Prospects,"Hao Cui, Taha Yasseri",Computers and Society (cs.CY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"The current societal challenges exceed the capacity of human individual or collective effort alone. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives is poised to vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, when synergized, can achieve a level of collective intelligence that surpasses the collective capabilities of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising a cognition layer, a physical layer, and an information layer. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. The interplay among these agents shapes the overall structure and dynamics of the system. We explore how agents' diversity and interactions influence the system's collective intelligence. Furthermore, we present an analysis of real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by addressing the potential challenges in AI-enhanced collective intelligence and offer perspectives on future developments in this field.    "
SWAG: Splatting in the Wild images with Appearance-conditioned Gaussians,"Hiba Dahmani, Moussab Bennehar, Nathan Piasco, Luis Roldao, Dzmitry Tsishkou",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Implicit neural representation methods have shown impressive advancements in learning 3D scenes from unstructured in-the-wild photo collections but are still limited by the large computational cost of volumetric rendering. More recently, 3D Gaussian Splatting emerged as a much faster alternative with superior rendering quality and training efficiency, especially for small-scale and object-centric scenarios. Nevertheless, this technique suffers from poor performance on unstructured in-the-wild data. To tackle this, we extend over 3D Gaussian Splatting to handle unstructured image collections. We achieve this by modeling appearance to seize photometric variations in the rendered images. Additionally, we introduce a new mechanism to train transient Gaussians to handle the presence of scene occluders in an unsupervised manner. Experiments on diverse photo collection scenes and multi-pass acquisition of outdoor landmarks show the effectiveness of our method over prior works achieving state-of-the-art results with improved efficiency.

"NeuFlow: Real-time, High-accuracy Optical Flow Estimation on Robots  Using Edge Devices","Zhiyong Zhang, Huaizu Jiang, Hanumant Singh",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Robotics (cs.RO),"Real-time high-accuracy optical flow estimation is a crucial component in various applications, including localization and mapping in robotics, object tracking, and activity recognition in computer vision. While recent learning-based optical flow methods have achieved high accuracy, they often come with heavy computation costs. In this paper, we propose a highly efficient optical flow architecture, called NeuFlow, that addresses both high accuracy and computational cost concerns. The architecture follows a global-to-local scheme. Given the features of the input images extracted at different spatial resolutions, global matching is employed to estimate an initial optical flow on the 1/16 resolution, capturing large displacement, which is then refined on the 1/8 resolution with lightweight CNN layers for better accuracy. We evaluate our approach on Jetson Orin Nano and RTX 2080 to demonstrate efficiency improvements across different computing platforms. We achieve a notable 10x-80x speedup compared to several state-of-the-art methods, while maintaining comparable accuracy. Our approach achieves around 30 FPS on edge computing platforms, which represents a significant breakthrough in deploying complex computer vision tasks such as SLAM on small robots like drones.

Structured Evaluation of Synthetic Tabular Data,"Scott Cheng-Hsin Yang, Baxter Eaves, Michael Schmidt, Ken Swanson, Patrick Shafto",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"Tabular data is common yet typically incomplete, small in volume, and access-restricted due to privacy concerns. Synthetic data generation offers potential solutions. Many metrics exist for evaluating the quality of synthetic tabular data; however, we lack an objective, coherent interpretation of the many metrics. To address this issue, we propose an evaluation framework with a single, mathematical objective that posits that the synthetic data should be drawn from the same distribution as the observed data. Through various structural decomposition of the objective, this framework allows us to reason for the first time the completeness of any set of metrics, as well as unifies existing metrics, including those that stem from fidelity considerations, downstream application, and model-based approaches. Moreover, the framework motivates model-free baselines and a new spectrum of metrics. We evaluate structurally informed synthesizers and synthesizers powered by deep learning. Using our structured framework, we show that synthetic data generators that explicitly represent tabular structure outperform other methods, especially on smaller datasets.    "

Concretely, for Gaussian robust $k$-sparse mean estimation on $\mathbb{R}^d$ with corruption rate $\epsilon>0$, our algorithm has sample complexity $(k^2/\epsilon^2)\mathrm{polylog}(d/\epsilon)$, runs in sample polynomial time, and approximates the target mean within $\ell_2$-error $O(\epsilon)$. Previous efficient algorithms inherently incur error $\Omega(\epsilon \sqrt{\log(1/\epsilon)})$.

Gradient based Feature Attribution in Explainable AI: A Technical Review,"Yongjie Wang, Tong Zhang, Xu Guo, Zhiqi Shen",Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"The surge in black-box AI models has prompted the need to explain the internal mechanism and justify their reliability, especially in high-stakes applications, such as healthcare and autonomous driving. Due to the lack of a rigorous definition of explainable AI (XAI), a plethora of research related to explainability, interpretability, and transparency has been developed to explain and analyze the model from various perspectives. Consequently, with an exhaustive list of papers, it becomes challenging to have a comprehensive overview of XAI research from all aspects. Considering the popularity of neural networks in AI research, we narrow our focus to a specific area of XAI research: gradient based explanations, which can be directly adopted for neural network models. In this review, we systematically explore gradient based explanation methods to date and introduce a novel taxonomy to categorize them into four distinct classes. Then, we present the essence of technique details in chronological order and underscore the evolution of algorithms. Next, we introduce both human and quantitative evaluations to measure algorithm performance. More importantly, we demonstrate the general challenges in XAI and specific challenges in gradient based explanations. We hope that this survey can help researchers understand state-of-the-art progress and their corresponding disadvantages, which could spark their interest in addressing these issues in future work.

Real-Time Image Segmentation via Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer  Architecture Search,"Hongyuan Yu, Cheng Wan, Mengchen Liu, Dongdong Chen, Bin Xiao, Xiyang Dai",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Image segmentation is one of the most fundamental problems in computer vision and has drawn a lot of attentions due to its vast applications in image understanding and autonomous driving. However, designing effective and efficient segmentation neural architectures is a labor-intensive process that may require lots of trials by human experts. In this paper, we address the challenge of integrating multi-head self-attention into high resolution representation CNNs efficiently, by leveraging architecture search. Manually replacing convolution layers with multi-head self-attention is non-trivial due to the costly overhead in memory to maintain high resolution. By contrast, we develop a multi-target multi-branch supernet method, which not only fully utilizes the advantages of high-resolution features, but also finds the proper location for placing multi-head self-attention module. Our search algorithm is optimized towards multiple objective s (e.g., latency and mIoU) and capable of finding architectures on Pareto frontier with arbitrary number of branches in a single search. We further present a series of model via Hybrid Convolutional-Transformer Architecture Search (HyCTAS) method that searched for the best hybrid combination of light-weight convolution layers and memory-efficient self-attention layers between branches from different resolutions and fuse to high resolution for both efficiency and effectiveness. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyCTAS outperforms previous methods on semantic segmentation task. Code and models are available at \url{this https URL}.    "

However, the evolution towards the 5G technology and beyond poses new security challenges that must be addressed in order to fulfill the unprecedented performance requirements of future wireless networks. Among the potential enabling technologies, RIS has attracted extensive attention due to its ability to proactively and intelligently reconfigure the wireless propagation environment to combat dynamic wireless channel impairments. Consequently, the RIS technology can be adopted to improve the information-theoretic security of both RF and OWC systems. This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of the information-theoretic security of RIS-based RF and optical systems. The article first discusses the fundamental concepts of PLS and RIS technologies, followed by their combination in both RF and OWC systems. Subsequently, some optimization techniques are presented in the context of the underlying system model, followed by an assessment of the impact of RIS-assisted PLS through a comprehensive performance analysis.

In the first set of experiments, we show how cross-encoder rerankers are hard to distinguish when it comes to re-rerank SPLADE on MS MARCO. Observations shift in the out-of-domain scenario, where both the type of model and the number of documents to re-rank have an impact on effectiveness.

Deep Bi-directional Attention Network for Image Super-Resolution Quality  Assessment,"Yixiao Li, Xiaoyuan Yang, Jun Fu, Guanghui Yue, Wei Zhou",Multimedia (cs.MM),"There has emerged a growing interest in exploring efficient quality assessment algorithms for image super-resolution (SR). However, employing deep learning techniques, especially dual-branch algorithms, to automatically evaluate the visual quality of SR images remains challenging. Existing SR image quality assessment (IQA) metrics based on two-stream networks lack interactions between branches. To address this, we propose a novel full-reference IQA (FR-IQA) method for SR images. Specifically, producing SR images and evaluating how close the SR images are to the corresponding HR references are separate processes. Based on this consideration, we construct a deep Bi-directional Attention Network (BiAtten-Net) that dynamically deepens visual attention to distortions in both processes, which aligns well with the human visual system (HVS). Experiments on public SR quality databases demonstrate the superiority of our proposed BiAtten-Net over state-of-the-art quality assessment methods.

A comparative study on machine learning approaches for rock mass  classification using drilling data,"Tom F. Hansen, Georg H. Erharter, Zhongqiang Liu, Jim Torresen",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Current rock engineering design in drill and blast tunnelling primarily relies on engineers' observational assessments. Measure While Drilling (MWD) data, a high-resolution sensor dataset collected during tunnel excavation, is underutilised, mainly serving for geological visualisation. This study aims to automate the translation of MWD data into actionable metrics for rock engineering. It seeks to link data to specific engineering actions, thus providing critical decision support for geological challenges ahead of the tunnel face. Leveraging a large and geologically diverse dataset of 500,000 drillholes from 15 tunnels, the research introduces models for accurate rock mass quality classification in a real-world tunnelling context. Both conventional machine learning and image-based deep learning are explored to classify MWD data into Q-classes and Q-values, examples of metrics describing the stability of the rock mass, using both tabular and image data. The results indicate that the K-nearest neighbours algorithm in an ensemble with tree-based models using tabular data, effectively classifies rock mass quality. It achieves a cross-validated balanced accuracy of 0.86 in classifying rock mass into the Q-classes A, B, C, D, E1, E2, and 0.95 for a binary classification with E versus the rest. Classification using a CNN with MWD-images for each blasting round resulted in a balanced accuracy of 0.82 for binary classification. Regressing the Q-value from tabular MWD-data achieved cross-validated R2 and MSE scores of 0.80 and 0.18 for a similar ensemble model as in classification. High performance in regression and classification boosts confidence in automated rock mass assessment. Applying advanced modelling on a unique dataset demonstrates MWD data's value in improving rock mass classification accuracy and advancing data-driven rock engineering design, reducing manual intervention.

Collaborative Aquatic Positioning system Utilising Multi-beam Sonar and  Depth Sensors,"Xueliang Cheng, Barry Lennox, Keir Groves",Robotics (cs.RO),"Accurate positioning of underwater robots in confined environments is crucial for inspection and mapping tasks and is also a prerequisite for autonomous operations. Presently, there are no positioning systems available that are suited for real-world use in confined underwater environments, unconstrained by environmental lighting and water turbidity levels and have sufficient accuracy for reliable and repeatable navigation. This shortage presents a significant barrier to enhancing the capabilities of ROVs in such scenarios. This paper introduces an innovative positioning system for ROVs operating in confined, cluttered underwater settings, achieved through the collaboration of an omnidirectional surface vehicle and an ROV. A formulation is proposed and evaluated in the simulation against ground truth. The experimental results from the simulation form a proof of principle of the proposed system and also demonstrate its deployability.

On well-posedness of the leak localization problem in parallel pipe  networks,"Victor MolnÃ¶, Henrik Sandberg",Systems and Control (eess.SY),"With the advent of integrated sensor technology (smart flow meters and pressure sensors), various new numerical algorithms for leak localization (a core element of water distribution system operation) have been developed. However, there is a lack of theory regarding the limitations of leak localization. In this work, we contribute to the development of such a theory by introducing an example water network structure with parallel pipes that is tractable for analytical treatment. We define the leak localization problem for this structure and show how many sensors and what conditions are needed for the well-posedness of the problem. We present a formula for the leak position as a function of measurements from these sensors. However, we also highlight the risk of finding false but plausible leak positions in the multiple pipes. We try to answer the questions of how and when the leaking pipe can be isolated. In particular, we show that nonlinearities in the pipes' head loss functions are essential for the well-posedness of the isolation problem. We propose procedures to get around the pitfall of multiple plausible leak positions.    "
Isotropic3D: Image-to-3D Generation Based on a Single CLIP Embedding,"Pengkun Liu, Yikai Wang, Fuchun Sun, Jiafang Li, Hang Xiao, Hongxiang Xue, Xinzhou Wang",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Encouraged by the growing availability of pre-trained 2D diffusion models, image-to-3D generation by leveraging Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) is making remarkable progress. Most existing methods combine novel-view lifting from 2D diffusion models which usually take the reference image as a condition while applying hard L2 image supervision at the reference view. Yet heavily adhering to the image is prone to corrupting the inductive knowledge of the 2D diffusion model leading to flat or distorted 3D generation frequently. In this work, we reexamine image-to-3D in a novel perspective and present Isotropic3D, an image-to-3D generation pipeline that takes only an image CLIP embedding as input. Isotropic3D allows the optimization to be isotropic w.r.t. the azimuth angle by solely resting on the SDS loss. The core of our framework lies in a two-stage diffusion model fine-tuning. Firstly, we fine-tune a text-to-3D diffusion model by substituting its text encoder with an image encoder, by which the model preliminarily acquires image-to-image capabilities. Secondly, we perform fine-tuning using our Explicit Multi-view Attention (EMA) which combines noisy multi-view images with the noise-free reference image as an explicit condition. CLIP embedding is sent to the diffusion model throughout the whole process while reference images are discarded once after fine-tuning. As a result, with a single image CLIP embedding, Isotropic3D is capable of generating multi-view mutually consistent images and also a 3D model with more symmetrical and neat content, well-proportioned geometry, rich colored texture, and less distortion compared with existing image-to-3D methods while still preserving the similarity to the reference image to a large extent.

CDMAD: Class-Distribution-Mismatch-Aware Debiasing for Class-Imbalanced  Semi-Supervised Learning,"Hyuck Lee, Heeyoung Kim",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Pseudo-label-based semi-supervised learning (SSL) algorithms trained on a class-imbalanced set face two cascading challenges: 1) Classifiers tend to be biased towards majority classes, and 2) Biased pseudo-labels are used for training. It is difficult to appropriately re-balance the classifiers in SSL because the class distribution of an unlabeled set is often unknown and could be mismatched with that of a labeled set. We propose a novel class-imbalanced SSL algorithm called class-distribution-mismatch-aware debiasing (CDMAD). For each iteration of training, CDMAD first assesses the classifier's biased degree towards each class by calculating the logits on an image without any patterns (e.g., solid color image), which can be considered irrelevant to the training set. CDMAD then refines biased pseudo-labels of the base SSL algorithm by ensuring the classifier's neutrality. CDMAD uses these refined pseudo-labels during the training of the base SSL algorithm to improve the quality of the representations. In the test phase, CDMAD similarly refines biased class predictions on test samples. CDMAD can be seen as an extension of post-hoc logit adjustment to address a challenge of incorporating the unknown class distribution of the unlabeled set for re-balancing the biased classifier under class distribution mismatch. CDMAD ensures Fisher consistency for the balanced error. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CDMAD.    "
Evaluating Perceptual Distances by Fitting Binomial Distributions to  Two-Alternative Forced Choice Data,"Alexander Hepburn, Raul Santos-Rodriguez, Javier Portilla",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"The two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) experimental setup is popular in the visual perception literature, where practitioners aim to understand how human observers perceive distances within triplets that consist of a reference image and two distorted versions of that image. In the past, this had been conducted in controlled environments, with a tournament-style algorithm dictating which images are shown to each participant to rank the distorted images. Recently, crowd-sourced perceptual datasets have emerged, with no images shared between triplets, making ranking impossible. Evaluating perceptual distances using this data is non-trivial, relying on reducing the collection of judgements on a triplet to a binary decision -- which is suboptimal and prone to misleading conclusions. Instead, we statistically model the underlying decision-making process during 2AFC experiments using a binomial distribution. We use maximum likelihood estimation to fit a distribution to the perceptual judgements, conditioned on the perceptual distance to test and impose consistency and smoothness between our empirical estimates of the density. This way, we can evaluate a different number of judgements per triplet, and can calculate metrics such as likelihoods of judgements according to a set of distances -- key ingredients that neural network counterparts lack.

Coordination in Noncooperative Multiplayer Matrix Games via Reduced Rank  Correlated Equilibria,"Jaehan Im, Yue Yu, David Fridovich-Keil, Ufuk Topcu",Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Systems and Control (eess.SY),"Coordination in multiplayer games enables players to avoid the lose-lose outcome that often arises at Nash equilibria. However, designing a coordination mechanism typically requires the consideration of the joint actions of all players, which becomes intractable in large-scale games. We develop a novel coordination mechanism, termed reduced rank correlated equilibria, which reduces the number of joint actions to be considered and thereby mitigates computational complexity. The idea is to approximate the set of all joint actions with the actions used in a set of pre-computed Nash equilibria via a convex hull operation. In a game with n players and each player having m actions, the proposed mechanism reduces the number of joint actions considered from O(m^n) to O(mn). We demonstrate the application of the proposed mechanism to an air traffic queue management problem. Compared with the correlated equilibrium-a popular benchmark coordination mechanism-the proposed approach is capable of solving a queue management problem involving four thousand times more joint actions. In the meantime, it yields a solution that shows a 58.5% to 99.5% improvement in the fairness indicator and a 1.8% to 50.4% reduction in average delay cost compared to the Nash solution, which does not involve coordination.

Monotonic Representation of Numeric Properties in Language Models,"Benjamin Heinzerling, Kentaro Inui",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Language models (LMs) can express factual knowledge involving numeric properties such as Karl Popper was born in 1902. However, how this information is encoded in the model's internal representations is not understood well. Here, we introduce a simple method for finding and editing representations of numeric properties such as an entity's birth year. Empirically, we find low-dimensional subspaces that encode numeric properties monotonically, in an interpretable and editable fashion. When editing representations along directions in these subspaces, LM output changes accordingly. For example, by patching activations along a ""birthyear"" direction we can make the LM express an increasingly late birthyear: Karl Popper was born in 1929, Karl Popper was born in 1957, Karl Popper was born in 1968. Property-encoding directions exist across several numeric properties in all models under consideration, suggesting the possibility that monotonic representation of numeric properties consistently emerges during LM pretraining.

BirdSet: A Multi-Task Benchmark for Classification in Avian Bioacoustics,"Lukas Rauch, Raphael Schwinger, Moritz Wirth, RenÃ© Heinrich, Jonas Lange, Stefan Kahl, Bernhard Sick, Sven Tomforde, Christoph Scholz",Sound (cs.SD); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS),"Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a powerful tool in avian bioacoustics to diagnose environmental health and biodiversity.

Reliable DL models need to analyze bird calls flexibly across various species and environments to fully harness the potential of bioacoustics in a cost-effective passive acoustic monitoring scenario. Data fragmentation and opacity across studies complicate a comprehensive evaluation of general model performance. To overcome these challenges, we present the BirdSet benchmark, a unified framework consolidating research efforts with a holistic approach for classifying bird vocalizations in avian bioacoustics. BirdSet harmonizes open-source bird recordings into a curated dataset collection. This unified approach provides an in-depth understanding of model performance and identifies potential shortcomings across different tasks. By establishing baseline results of current models, BirdSet aims to facilitate comparability, guide subsequent data collection, and increase accessibility for newcomers to avian bioacoustics.    "
Regret Minimization via Saddle Point Optimization,"Johannes Kirschner, Seyed Alireza Bakhtiari, Kushagra Chandak, Volodymyr Tkachuk, Csaba SzepesvÃ¡ri",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"A long line of works characterizes the sample complexity of regret minimization in sequential decision-making by min-max programs. In the corresponding saddle-point game, the min-player optimizes the sampling distribution against an adversarial max-player that chooses confusing models leading to large regret. The most recent instantiation of this idea is the decision-estimation coefficient (DEC), which was shown to provide nearly tight lower and upper bounds on the worst-case expected regret in structured bandits and reinforcement learning. By re-parametrizing the offset DEC with the confidence radius and solving the corresponding min-max program, we derive an anytime variant of the Estimation-To-Decisions (E2D) algorithm. Importantly, the algorithm optimizes the exploration-exploitation trade-off online instead of via the analysis. Our formulation leads to a practical algorithm for finite model classes and linear feedback models. We further point out connections to the information ratio, decoupling coefficient and PAC-DEC, and numerically evaluate the performance of E2D on simple examples.    "

Solving the problems in the dataset requires advanced perception and joint reasoning over the text and the visual content of the image. Our evaluation results demonstrate that this is a challenging dataset, which is difficult even for advanced vision-text models such as GPT-4V and Gemini; this underscores the inherent complexity of the dataset and its significance as a future benchmark.

However, the intricate nature of self-attention introduces practical challenges, as existing state-of-the-art methods often demand high-end GPUs or exhibit slow inference speeds, especially for high-resolution images like 2K. Striking an optimal balance between performance and latency remains a critical concern. In response, this work presents PASTA, a novel Progressively Aggregated Spatio-Temporal Alignment framework for HDR deghosting. Our approach achieves effectiveness and efficiency by harnessing hierarchical representation during feature distanglement. Through the utilization of diverse granularities within the hierarchical structure, our method substantially boosts computational speed and optimizes the HDR imaging workflow. In addition, we explore within-scale feature modeling with local and global attention, gradually merging and refining them in a coarse-to-fine fashion.

Towards a general framework for improving the performance of classifiers  using XAI methods,"Andrea Apicella, Salvatore Giugliano, Francesco IsgrÃ², Roberto Prevete",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Modern Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems, especially Deep Learning (DL) models, poses challenges in understanding their inner workings by AI researchers. eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) inspects internal mechanisms of AI models providing explanations about their decisions.

This paper proposes a general framework for automatically improving the performance of pre-trained DL classifiers using XAI methods, avoiding the computational overhead associated with retraining complex models from scratch. In particular, we outline the possibility of two different learning strategies for implementing this architecture, which we will call auto-encoder-based and encoder-decoder-based, and discuss their key aspects.

Construction of all MDS and involutory MDS matrices,"Yogesh Kumar, P.R.Mishra, Susanta Samanta, Kishan Chand Gupta, Atul Gaur",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),"In this paper, we propose two algorithms for a hybrid construction of all $n\times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$, respectively. The proposed algorithms effectively narrow down the search space to identify $(n-1) \times (n-1)$ MDS matrices, facilitating the generation of all $n \times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. To the best of our knowledge, existing literature lacks methods for generating all $n\times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. In our approach, we introduce a representative matrix form for generating all $n\times n$ MDS and involutory MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. The determination of these representative MDS matrices involves searching through all $(n-1)\times (n-1)$ MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{p^m}$. Our contributions extend to proving that the count of all $3\times 3$ MDS matrices over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ is precisely $(2^m-1)^5(2^m-2)(2^m-3)(2^{2m}-9\cdot 2^m+21)$.

An Energy-Efficient Ensemble Approach for Mitigating Data Incompleteness  in IoT Applications,"Yousef AlShehri, Lakshmish Ramaswamy",Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),"Machine Learning (ML) is becoming increasingly important for IoT-based applications. However, the dynamic and ad-hoc nature of many IoT ecosystems poses unique challenges to the efficacy of ML algorithms. One such challenge is data incompleteness, which is manifested as missing sensor readings. Many factors, including sensor failures and/or network disruption, can cause data incompleteness. Furthermore, most IoT systems are severely power-constrained. It is important that we build IoT-based ML systems that are robust against data incompleteness while simultaneously being energy efficient. This paper presents an empirical study of SECOE - a recent technique for alleviating data incompleteness in IoT - with respect to its energy bottlenecks. Towards addressing the energy bottlenecks of SECOE, we propose ENAMLE - a proactive, energy-aware technique for mitigating the impact of concurrent missing data. ENAMLE is unique in the sense that it builds an energy-aware ensemble of sub-models, each trained with a subset of sensors chosen carefully based on their correlations. Furthermore, at inference time, ENAMLE adaptively alters the number of the ensemble of models based on the amount of missing data rate and the energy-accuracy trade-off. ENAMLE's design includes several novel mechanisms for minimizing energy consumption while maintaining accuracy. We present extensive experimental studies on two distinct datasets that demonstrate the energy efficiency of ENAMLE and its ability to alleviate sensor failures.    "

Due to that the new class of decomposition algorithms for separable Hamiltonian systems with quadratic kinetic energy may be particularly useful when applied to Hamiltonian systems where an evaluation of the Hessian is significantly more expensive than an evaluation of its gradient, e.g. in molecular dynamics simulations of classical systems. Numerical experiments of an N-body problem, as well as applications to the molecular dynamics step in the Hybrid Monte Carlo (HMC) algorithm for lattice simulations of the Schwinger model and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) verify these expectations.

Testing MediaPipe Holistic for Linguistic Analysis of Nonmanual Markers  in Sign Languages,"Anna Kuznetsova, Vadim Kimmelman",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Advances in Deep Learning have made possible reliable landmark tracking of human bodies and faces that can be used for a variety of tasks. We test a recent Computer Vision solution, MediaPipe Holistic (MPH), to find out if its tracking of the facial features is reliable enough for a linguistic analysis of data from sign languages, and compare it to an older solution (OpenFace, OF). We use an existing data set of sentences in Kazakh-Russian Sign Language and a newly created small data set of videos with head tilts and eyebrow movements. We find that MPH does not perform well enough for linguistic analysis of eyebrow movement -- but in a different way from OF, which is also performing poorly without correction. We reiterate a previous proposal to train additional correction models to overcome these limitations.    "
Scalable Algorithms for Individual Preference Stable Clustering,"Ron Mosenzon, Ali Vakilian",Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"In this paper, we study the individual preference (IP) stability, which is an notion capturing individual fairness and stability in clustering. Within this setting, a clustering is $\alpha$-IP stable when each data point's average distance to its cluster is no more than $\alpha$ times its average distance to any other cluster. In this paper, we study the natural local search algorithm for IP stable clustering. Our analysis confirms a $O(\log n)$-IP stability guarantee for this algorithm, where $n$ denotes the number of points in the input. Furthermore, by refining the local search approach, we show it runs in an almost linear time, $\tilde{O}(nk)$.    "
Unveiling Wash Trading in Popular NFT Markets,"Yuanzheng Niu, Xiaoqi Li, Hongli Peng, Wenkai Li",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),"As emerging digital assets, NFTs are susceptible to anomalous trading behaviors due to the lack of stringent regulatory mechanisms, potentially causing economic losses.

Furthermore, we propose a heuristic algorithm that integrates the network characteristics of transactions with behavioral analysis, to detect wash trading activities in NFT markets. Our findings indicate that NFT markets with incentivized structures exhibit higher proportions of wash trading volume compared to those without incentives. Notably, the LooksRare and X2Y2 markets are detected with wash trading volume proportions as high as 94.5% and 84.2%, respectively.    "
ANIM: Accurate Neural Implicit Model for Human Reconstruction from a  single RGB-D image,"Marco Pesavento, Yuanlu Xu, Nikolaos Sarafianos, Robert Maier, Ziyan Wang, Chun-Han Yao, Marco Volino, Edmond Boyer, Adrian Hilton, Tony Tung",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Graphics (cs.GR),"Recent progress in human shape learning, shows that neural implicit models are effective in generating 3D human surfaces from limited number of views, and even from a single RGB image. However, existing monocular approaches still struggle to recover fine geometric details such as face, hands or cloth wrinkles. They are also easily prone to depth ambiguities that result in distorted geometries along the camera optical axis. In this paper, we explore the benefits of incorporating depth observations in the reconstruction process by introducing ANIM, a novel method that reconstructs arbitrary 3D human shapes from single-view RGB-D images with an unprecedented level of accuracy. Our model learns geometric details from both multi-resolution pixel-aligned and voxel-aligned features to leverage depth information and enable spatial relationships, mitigating depth ambiguities. We further enhance the quality of the reconstructed shape by introducing a depth-supervision strategy, which improves the accuracy of the signed distance field estimation of points that lie on the reconstructed surface. Experiments demonstrate that ANIM outperforms state-of-the-art works that use RGB, surface normals, point cloud or RGB-D data as input. In addition, we introduce ANIM-Real, a new multi-modal dataset comprising high-quality scans paired with consumer-grade RGB-D camera, and our protocol to fine-tune ANIM, enabling high-quality reconstruction from real-world human capture.

Resolving Full-Wave Through-Wall Transmission Effects in Multi-Static  Synthetic Aperture Radar,"Francis Watson, Daniel Andre, William Robert Breckon Lionheart",Numerical Analysis (math.NA),"Through-wall synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging is of significant interest for security purposes, in particular when using multi-static SAR systems consisting of multiple distributed radar transmitters and receivers to improve resolution and the ability to recognise objects. Yet there is a significant challenge in forming focused, useful images due to multiple scattering effects through walls, whereas standard SAR imaging has an inherent single scattering assumption. This may be exacerbated with multi-static collections, since different scattering events will be observed from each angle and the data may not coherently combine well in a naive manner. To overcome this, we propose an image formation method which resolves full-wave effects through an approximately known wall or other arbitrary obstacle, which itself has some unknown ""nuisance"" parameters that are determined as part of the reconstruction to provide well focused images. The method is more flexible and realistic than existing methods which treat a single wall as a flat layered medium, whilst being significantly computationally cheaper than full-wave methods, strongly motivated by practical considerations for through-wall SAR.

SimPB: A Single Model for 2D and 3D Object Detection from Multiple  Cameras,"Yingqi Tang, Zhaotie Meng, Guoliang Chen, Erkang Cheng",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"The field of autonomous driving has attracted considerable interest in approaches that directly infer 3D objects in the Bird's Eye View (BEV) from multiple cameras. Some attempts have also explored utilizing 2D detectors from single images to enhance the performance of 3D detection. However, these approaches rely on a two-stage process with separate detectors, where the 2D detection results are utilized only once for token selection or query initialization. In this paper, we present a single model termed SimPB, which simultaneously detects 2D objects in the perspective view and 3D objects in the BEV space from multiple cameras. To achieve this, we introduce a hybrid decoder consisting of several multi-view 2D decoder layers and several 3D decoder layers, specifically designed for their respective detection tasks. A Dynamic Query Allocation module and an Adaptive Query Aggregation module are proposed to continuously update and refine the interaction between 2D and 3D results, in a cyclic 3D-2D-3D manner. Additionally, Query-group Attention is utilized to strengthen the interaction among 2D queries within each camera group. In the experiments, we evaluate our method on the nuScenes dataset and demonstrate promising results for both 2D and 3D detection tasks. Our code is available at: this https URL.    "
TriSum: Learning Summarization Ability from Large Language Models with  Structured Rationale,"Pengcheng Jiang, Cao Xiao, Zifeng Wang, Parminder Bhatia, Jimeng Sun, Jiawei Han",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"The advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced natural language processing tasks like text summarization.

Initially, LLMs extract a set of aspect-triple rationales and summaries, which are refined using a dual-scoring method for quality. Next, a smaller local model is trained with these tasks, employing a curriculum learning strategy that evolves from simple to complex tasks. Our method enhances local model performance on various benchmarks (CNN/DailyMail, XSum, and ClinicalTrial), outperforming baselines by 4.5%, 8.5%, and 7.4%, respectively.

ParaPoint: Learning Global Free-Boundary Surface Parameterization of 3D  Point Clouds,"Qijian Zhang, Junhui Hou, Ying He",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Surface parameterization is a fundamental geometry processing problem with rich downstream applications. Traditional approaches are designed to operate on well-behaved mesh models with high-quality triangulations that are laboriously produced by specialized 3D modelers, and thus unable to meet the processing demand for the current explosion of ordinary 3D data. In this paper, we seek to perform UV unwrapping on unstructured 3D point clouds. Technically, we propose ParaPoint, an unsupervised neural learning pipeline for achieving global free-boundary surface parameterization by building point-wise mappings between given 3D points and 2D UV coordinates with adaptively deformed boundaries. We ingeniously construct several geometrically meaningful sub-networks with specific functionalities, and assemble them into a bi-directional cycle mapping framework. We also design effective loss functions and auxiliary differential geometric constraints for the optimization of the neural mapping process. To the best of our knowledge, this work makes the first attempt to investigate neural point cloud parameterization that pursues both global mappings and free boundaries. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and inspiring potential of our proposed learning paradigm. The code will be publicly available.    "
Denoising Task Difficulty-based Curriculum for Training Diffusion Models,"Jin-Young Kim, Hyojun Go, Soonwoo Kwon, Hyun-Gyoon Kim",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Diffusion-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools in the realm of generative modeling. Despite extensive research on denoising across various timesteps and noise levels, a conflict persists regarding the relative difficulties of the denoising tasks. While various studies argue that lower timesteps present more challenging tasks, others contend that higher timesteps are more difficult. To address this conflict, our study undertakes a comprehensive examination of task difficulties, focusing on convergence behavior and changes in relative entropy between consecutive probability distributions across timesteps. Our observational study reveals that denoising at earlier timesteps poses challenges characterized by slower convergence and higher relative entropy, indicating increased task difficulty at these lower timesteps. Building on these observations, we introduce an easy-to-hard learning scheme, drawing from curriculum learning, to enhance the training process of diffusion models. By organizing timesteps or noise levels into clusters and training models with descending orders of difficulty, we facilitate an order-aware training regime, progressing from easier to harder denoising tasks, thereby deviating from the conventional approach of training diffusion models simultaneously across all timesteps. Our approach leads to improved performance and faster convergence by leveraging the benefits of curriculum learning, while maintaining orthogonality with existing improvements in diffusion training techniques. We validate these advantages through comprehensive experiments in image generation tasks, including unconditional, class-conditional, and text-to-image generation.    "

However, existing solutions struggle to reconstruct urban outdoor scenes due to their large, unbounded, and highly detailed nature. Hence, to achieve accurate reconstructions, additional supervision data such as LiDAR, strong geometric priors, and long training times are required. To tackle such issues, we present SCILLA, a new hybrid implicit surface learning method to reconstruct large driving scenes from 2D images. SCILLA's hybrid architecture models two separate implicit fields: one for the volumetric density and another for the signed distance to the surface. To accurately represent urban outdoor scenarios, we introduce a novel volume-rendering strategy that relies on self-supervised probabilistic density estimation to sample points near the surface and transition progressively from volumetric to surface representation. Our solution permits a proper and fast initialization of the signed distance field without relying on any geometric prior on the scene, compared to concurrent methods. By conducting extensive experiments on four outdoor driving datasets, we show that SCILLA can learn an accurate and detailed 3D surface scene representation in various urban scenarios while being two times faster to train compared to previous state-of-the-art solutions.

Cooperative Jamming for Physical Layer Security Enhancement Using Deep  Reinforcement Learning,"Sayed Amir Hoseini, Faycal Bouhafs, Neda Aboutorab, Parastoo Sadeghi, Frank den Hartog",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),"Wireless data communications are always facing the risk of eavesdropping and interception.

Thermal-NeRF: Neural Radiance Fields from an Infrared Camera,"Tianxiang Ye, Qi Wu, Junyuan Deng, Guoqing Liu, Liu Liu, Songpengcheng Xia, Liang Pang, Wenxian Yu, Ling Pei",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Robotics (cs.RO),"In recent years, Neural Radiance Fields (NeRFs) have demonstrated significant potential in encoding highly-detailed 3D geometry and environmental appearance, positioning themselves as a promising alternative to traditional explicit representation for 3D scene reconstruction.

Generation is better than Modification: Combating High Class Homophily  Variance in Graph Anomaly Detection,"Rui Zhang, Dawei Cheng, Xin Liu, Jie Yang, Yi Ouyang, Xian Wu, Yefeng Zheng",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Graph-based anomaly detection is currently an important research topic in the field of graph neural networks (GNNs). We find that in graph anomaly detection, the homophily distribution differences between different classes are significantly greater than those in homophilic and heterophilic graphs. For the first time, we introduce a new metric called Class Homophily Variance, which quantitatively describes this phenomenon. To mitigate its impact, we propose a novel GNN model named Homophily Edge Generation Graph Neural Network (HedGe). Previous works typically focused on pruning, selecting or connecting on original relationships, and we refer to these methods as modifications. Different from these works, our method emphasizes generating new relationships with low class homophily variance, using the original relationships as an auxiliary. HedGe samples homophily adjacency matrices from scratch using a self-attention mechanism, and leverages nodes that are relevant in the feature space but not directly connected in the original graph. Additionally, we modify the loss function to punish the generation of unnecessary heterophilic edges by the model. Extensive comparison experiments demonstrate that HedGe achieved the best performance across multiple benchmark datasets, including anomaly detection and edgeless node classification. The proposed model also improves the robustness under the novel Heterophily Attack with increased class homophily variance on other graph classification tasks.    "
Investigating grammatical abstraction in language models using few-shot  learning of novel noun gender,"Priyanka Sukumaran, Conor Houghton, Nina Kazanina",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Humans can learn a new word and infer its grammatical properties from very few examples. They have an abstract notion of linguistic properties like grammatical gender and agreement rules that can be applied to novel syntactic contexts and words. Drawing inspiration from psycholinguistics, we conduct a noun learning experiment to assess whether an LSTM and a decoder-only transformer can achieve human-like abstraction of grammatical gender in French. Language models were tasked with learning the gender of a novel noun embedding from a few examples in one grammatical agreement context and predicting agreement in another, unseen context. We find that both language models effectively generalise novel noun gender from one to two learning examples and apply the learnt gender across agreement contexts, albeit with a bias for the masculine gender category. Importantly, the few-shot updates were only applied to the embedding layers, demonstrating that models encode sufficient gender information within the word embedding space. While the generalisation behaviour of models suggests that they represent grammatical gender as an abstract category, like humans, further work is needed to explore the details of how exactly this is implemented. For a comparative perspective with human behaviour, we conducted an analogous one-shot novel noun gender learning experiment, which revealed that native French speakers, like language models, also exhibited a masculine gender bias and are not excellent one-shot learners either.

How Powerful Potential of Attention on Image Restoration?,"Cong Wang, Jinshan Pan, Yeying Jin, Liyan Wang, Wei Wang, Gang Fu, Wenqi Ren, Xiaochun Cao",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Transformers have demonstrated their effectiveness in image restoration tasks. Existing Transformer architectures typically comprise two essential components: multi-head self-attention and feed-forward network (FFN). The former captures long-range pixel dependencies, while the latter enables the model to learn complex patterns and relationships in the data. Previous studies have demonstrated that FFNs are key-value memories \cite{geva2020transformer}, which are vital in modern Transformer architectures. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to explore the potential of attention mechanisms without using FFN and provide novel structures to demonstrate that removing FFN is flexible for image restoration. Specifically, we propose Continuous Scaling Attention (\textbf{CSAttn}), a method that computes attention continuously in three stages without using FFN. To achieve competitive performance, we propose a series of key components within the attention. Our designs provide a closer look at the attention mechanism and reveal that some simple operations can significantly affect the model performance. We apply our \textbf{CSAttn} to several image restoration tasks and show that our model can outperform CNN-based and Transformer-based image restoration approaches.    "
NECA: Neural Customizable Human Avatar,"Junjin Xiao, Qing Zhang, Zhan Xu, Wei-Shi Zheng",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Human avatar has become a novel type of 3D asset with various applications. Ideally, a human avatar should be fully customizable to accommodate different settings and environments. In this work, we introduce NECA, an approach capable of learning versatile human representation from monocular or sparse-view videos, enabling granular customization across aspects such as pose, shadow, shape, lighting and texture. The core of our approach is to represent humans in complementary dual spaces and predict disentangled neural fields of geometry, albedo, shadow, as well as an external lighting, from which we are able to derive realistic rendering with high-frequency details via volumetric rendering. Extensive experiments demonstrate the advantage of our method over the state-of-the-art methods in photorealistic rendering, as well as various editing tasks such as novel pose synthesis and relighting.

GreedyML: A Parallel Algorithm for Maximizing Submodular Functions,"Shivaram Gopal, S M Ferdous, Hemanta K. Maji, Alex Pothen","Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Machine Learning (cs.LG)","We describe a parallel approximation algorithm for maximizing monotone submodular functions subject to hereditary constraints on distributed memory multiprocessors. Our work is motivated by the need to solve submodular optimization problems on massive data sets, for practical applications in areas such as data summarization, machine learning, and graph sparsification. Our work builds on the randomized distributed RandGreedI algorithm, proposed by Barbosa, Ene, Nguyen, and Ward (2015). This algorithm computes a distributed solution by randomly partitioning the data among all the processors and then employing a single accumulation step in which all processors send their partial solutions to one processor. However, for large problems, the accumulation step could exceed the memory available on a processor, and the processor which performs the accumulation could become a computational bottleneck.Here, we propose a generalization of the RandGreedI algorithm that employs multiple accumulation steps to reduce the memory required. We analyze the approximation ratio and the time complexity of the algorithm (in the BSP model). We also evaluate the new GreedyML algorithm on three classes of problems, and report results from massive data sets with millions of elements. The results show that the GreedyML algorithm can solve problems where the sequential Greedy and distributed RandGreedI algorithms fail due to memory constraints. For certain computationally intensive problems, the GreedyML algorithm can be faster than the RandGreedI algorithm. The observed approximation quality of the solutions computed by the GreedyML algorithm closely matches those obtained by the RandGreedI algorithm on these problems.    "
Towards Non-Adversarial Algorithmic Recourse,"Tobias Leemann, Martin Pawelczyk, Bardh Prenkaj, Gjergji Kasneci",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"The streams of research on adversarial examples and counterfactual explanations have largely been growing independently. This has led to several recent works trying to elucidate their similarities and differences. Most prominently, it has been argued that adversarial examples, as opposed to counterfactual explanations, have a unique characteristic in that they lead to a misclassification compared to the ground truth. However, the computational goals and methodologies employed in existing counterfactual explanation and adversarial example generation methods often lack alignment with this requirement. Using formal definitions of adversarial examples and counterfactual explanations, we introduce non-adversarial algorithmic recourse and outline why in high-stakes situations, it is imperative to obtain counterfactual explanations that do not exhibit adversarial characteristics. We subsequently investigate how different components in the objective functions, e.g., the machine learning model or cost function used to measure distance, determine whether the outcome can be considered an adversarial example or not. Our experiments on common datasets highlight that these design choices are often more critical in deciding whether recourse is non-adversarial than whether recourse or attack algorithms are used. Furthermore, we show that choosing a robust and accurate machine learning model results in less adversarial recourse desired in practice.    "
The cool and the cruel: separating hard parts of LWE secrets,"Niklas Nolte, Mohamed Malhou, Emily Wenger, Samuel Stevens, Cathy Li, FranÃ§ois Charton, Kristin Lauter",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),"Sparse binary LWE secrets are under consideration for standardization for Homomorphic Encryption and its applications to private computation. Known attacks on sparse binary LWE secrets include the sparse dual attack and the hybrid sparse dual-meet in the middle attack which requires significant memory. In this paper, we provide a new statistical attack with low memory requirement. The attack relies on some initial lattice reduction. The key observation is that, after lattice reduction is applied to the rows of a q-ary-like embedded random matrix $\mathbf A$, the entries with high variance are concentrated in the early columns of the extracted matrix. This allows us to separate out the ""hard part"" of the LWE secret. We can first solve the sub-problem of finding the ""cruel"" bits of the secret in the early columns, and then find the remaining ""cool"" bits in linear time. We use statistical techniques to distinguish distributions to identify both the cruel and the cool bits of the secret. We provide concrete attack timings for recovering secrets in dimensions $n=256$, $512$, and $768$. For the lattice reduction stage, we leverage recent improvements in lattice reduction (e.g. flatter) applied in parallel. We also apply our new attack in the RLWE setting for $2$-power cyclotomic rings, showing that these RLWE instances are much more vulnerable to this attack than LWE.    "
Unsupervised Threat Hunting using Continuous Bag-of-Terms-and-Time  (CBoTT),"Varol Kayhan, Shivendu Shivendu, Rouzbeh Behnia, Clinton Daniel, Manish Agrawal",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Threat hunting is sifting through system logs to detect malicious activities that might have bypassed existing security measures. It can be performed in several ways, one of which is based on detecting anomalies. We propose an unsupervised framework, called continuous bag-of-terms-and-time (CBoTT), and publish its application programming interface (API) to help researchers and cybersecurity analysts perform anomaly-based threat hunting among SIEM logs geared toward process auditing on endpoint devices. Analyses show that our framework consistently outperforms benchmark approaches. When logs are sorted by likelihood of being an anomaly (from most likely to least), our approach identifies anomalies at higher percentiles (between 1.82-6.46) while benchmark approaches identify the same anomalies at lower percentiles (between 3.25-80.92). This framework can be used by other researchers to conduct benchmark analyses and cybersecurity analysts to find anomalies in SIEM logs.    "
CDGP: Automatic Cloze Distractor Generation based on Pre-trained  Language Model,"Shang-Hsuan Chiang, Ssu-Cheng Wang, Yao-Chung Fan",Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Manually designing cloze test consumes enormous time and efforts. The major challenge lies in wrong option (distractor) selection. Having carefully-design distractors improves the effectiveness of learner ability assessment. As a result, the idea of automatically generating cloze distractor is motivated. In this paper, we investigate cloze distractor generation by exploring the employment of pre-trained language models (PLMs) as an alternative for candidate distractor generation. Experiments show that the PLM-enhanced model brings a substantial performance improvement. Our best performing model advances the state-of-the-art result from 14.94 to 34.17 (NDCG@10 score).

NetBench: A Large-Scale and Comprehensive Network Traffic Benchmark  Dataset for Foundation Models,"Chen Qian, Xiaochang Li, Qineng Wang, Gang Zhou, Huajie Shao",Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),"In computer networking, network traffic refers to the amount of data transmitted in the form of packets between internetworked computers or systems. Monitoring and analyzing network traffic is crucial for ensuring the performance, security, and reliability of a network. However, a significant challenge in network traffic analysis is to process diverse data packets including both ciphertext and plaintext. While many methods have been adopted to analyze network traffic, they often rely on different datasets for performance evaluation. This inconsistency results in substantial manual data processing efforts and unfair comparisons. Moreover, some data processing methods may cause data leakage due to improper separation of training and test data. To address these issues, we introduce NetBench, a large-scale and comprehensive benchmark dataset for assessing machine learning models, especially foundation models, in both traffic classification and generation tasks. NetBench is built upon seven publicly available datasets and encompasses a broad spectrum of 20 tasks, including 15 classification tasks and 5 generation tasks. Furthermore, we evaluate eight State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) classification models and two generative models using our benchmark. The results show that foundation models significantly outperform the traditional deep learning methods in traffic classification. We believe NetBench will facilitate fair comparisons among various approaches and advance the development of foundation models for network traffic. Our benchmark is available at this https URL.    "
Anytime Neural Architecture Search on Tabular Data,"Naili Xing, Shaofeng Cai, Zhaojing Luo, BengChin Ooi, Jian Pei",Machine Learning (cs.LG),"The increasing demand for tabular data analysis calls for transitioning from manual architecture design to Neural Architecture Search (NAS). This transition demands an efficient and responsive anytime NAS approach that is capable of returning current optimal architectures within any given time budget while progressively enhancing architecture quality with increased budget allocation. However, the area of research on Anytime NAS for tabular data remains unexplored. To this end, we introduce ATLAS, the first anytime NAS approach tailored for tabular data. ATLAS introduces a novel two-phase filtering-and-refinement optimization scheme with joint optimization, combining the strengths of both paradigms of training-free and training-based architecture evaluation. Specifically, in the filtering phase, ATLAS employs a new zero-cost proxy specifically designed for tabular data to efficiently estimate the performance of candidate architectures, thereby obtaining a set of promising architectures. Subsequently, in the refinement phase, ATLAS leverages a fixed-budget search algorithm to schedule the training of the promising candidates, so as to accurately identify the optimal architecture. To jointly optimize the two phases for anytime NAS, we also devise a budget-aware coordinator that delivers high NAS performance within constraints. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our ATLAS can obtain a good-performing architecture within any predefined time budget and return better architectures as and when a new time budget is made available. Overall, it reduces the search time on tabular data by up to 82.75x compared to existing NAS approaches.    "
Hierarchical Provision of Distribution Grid Flexibility with Online  Feedback Optimization,"Florian Klein-Helmkamp, Irina Zettl, Florian Schmidtke, Lukas Ortmann, Andreas Ulbig",Systems and Control (eess.SY),"Utilizing distribution grid flexibility for ancillary services requires the coordination and dispatch of requested active and reactive power to a large number of distributed energy resources in underlying grid layers. This paper presents an approach to hierarchically dispatch flexibility requests based on Online Feedback Optimization (OFO). We implement a framework of individual controllers coordinating actors, contributing to flexibility provision, to track a requested operating point at the interface between grid layers. The framework is evaluated in terms of performance during coordination and possible interaction between individual controllers, both central and distributed. Results show high reliability and robustness of the OFO controllers as well as an efficient dispatch of active and reactive power. Its computational efficiency and capabilities in set point tracking during online grid operation are making OFO a promising approach to the flexibility dispatch problem.    "
Interactive Trimming against Evasive Online Data Manipulation Attacks: A  Game-Theoretic Approach,"Yue Fu, Qingqing Ye, Rong Du, Haibo Hu",Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Databases (cs.DB),"With the exponential growth of data and its crucial impact on our lives and decision-making, the integrity of data has become a significant concern. Malicious data poisoning attacks, where false values are injected into the data, can disrupt machine learning processes and lead to severe consequences. To mitigate these attacks, distance-based defenses, such as trimming, have been proposed, but they can be easily evaded by white-box attackers. The evasiveness and effectiveness of poisoning attack strategies are two sides of the same coin, making game theory a promising approach. However, existing game-theoretical models often overlook the complexities of online data poisoning attacks, where strategies must adapt to the dynamic process of data collection.In this paper, we present an interactive game-theoretical model to defend online data manipulation attacks using the trimming strategy. Our model accommodates a complete strategy space, making it applicable to strong evasive and colluding adversaries. Leveraging the principle of least action and the Euler-Lagrange equation from theoretical physics, we derive an analytical model for the game-theoretic process. To demonstrate its practical usage, we present a case study in a privacy-preserving data collection system under local differential privacy where a non-deterministic utility function is adopted. Two strategies are devised from this analytical model, namely, Tit-for-tat and Elastic. We conduct extensive experiments on real-world datasets, which showcase the effectiveness and accuracy of these two strategies.    "
Designing User-Centered Simulations of Leadership Situations for Cave  Automatic Virtual Environments: Development and Usability Study,"Francesco Vona, Miladin ÄeraniÄ, Irma Rybnikova, Jan-Niklas Voigt-Antons",Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),"Given that experience is a pivotal dimension of learning processes in the field of leadership, the ongoing and unresolved issue is how such experiential moments could be provided when developing leadership skills and competencies. Role-plays and business simulations are widely used in this context as they are said to teach relevant social leadership skills, like those required by everyday communication to followers, by decision-making on compensation, evaluating performance, dealing with conflicts, or terminating contracts. However, the effectiveness of simulations can highly vary depending on the counterpart's ability to act in the given scenarios. In our project, we deal with how immersive media could create experiential learning based on simulations for leadership development. In recent years different variations of extended reality got significant technological improvements. Head-mounted displays are an easy and cost-efficient way to present high-resolution virtual environments. For groups of people that are part of an immersive experience, cave automatic virtual environments offer an excellent trade-off between actual exchange with other humans and interaction with virtual content simultaneously. The work presented is based on developing a user-centered simulation of leadership situations for cave automatic virtual environments and includes the results of a first usability study. In the future, the presented results can help to support the development and evaluation of simulated situations for cave automatic virtual environments with an emphasis on leadership-related scenarios.

"A canonical tree decomposition for order types, and some applications","Mathilde Bouvel, Valentin FÃ©ray, Xavier Goaoc, Florent Koechlin",Computational Geometry (cs.CG); Combinatorics (math.CO),"We introduce and study a notion of decomposition of planar point sets (or rather of their chirotopes) as trees decorated by smaller chirotopes. This decomposition is based on the concept of mutually avoiding sets (which we rephrase as \emph{modules}), and adapts in some sense the modular decomposition of graphs in the world of chirotopes. The associated tree always exists and is unique up to some appropriate constraints. We also show how to compute the number of triangulations of a chirotope efficiently, starting from its tree and the (weighted) numbers of triangulations of its parts.    "

Revolutionizing Packaging: A Robotic Bagging Pipeline with  Constraint-aware Structure-of-Interest Planning,"Jiaming Qi, Peng Zhou, Pai Zheng, Hongmin Wu, Chenguang Yang, David Navarro-Alarcon, Jia Pan",Robotics (cs.RO),"Bagging operations, common in packaging and assisted living applications, are challenging due to a bag's complex deformable properties. To address this, we develop a robotic system for automated bagging tasks using an adaptive structure-of-interest (SOI) manipulation approach. Our method relies on real-time visual feedback to dynamically adjust manipulation without requiring prior knowledge of bag materials or dynamics. We present a robust pipeline featuring state estimation for SOIs using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM), SOI generation via optimization-based bagging techniques, SOI motion planning with Constrained Bidirectional Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (CBiRRT), and dual-arm manipulation coordinated by Model Predictive Control (MPC). Experiments demonstrate the system's ability to achieve precise, stable bagging of various objects using adaptive coordination of the manipulators. The proposed framework advances the capability of dual-arm robots to perform more sophisticated automation of common tasks involving interactions with deformable objects.    "
Supplement Matrix and a Practical Method for Computing Eigenvalues of a  Dual Hermitian Matrix,"Liqun Qi, Chunfeng Cui",Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Rings and Algebras (math.RA),"We study dual number symmetric matrices, dual complex Hermitian matrices and dual quaternion Hermitian matrices in a unified frame of dual Hermitian matrices. Suppose we have a ring, which can be the real field, the complex field, or the quaternion ring. Then an $n \times n$ dual Hermitian matrix has $n$ dual number eigenvalues.We define supplement matrices for a dual Hermitian matrix. Supplement matrices are Hermitian matrices in the original ring. The standard parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of the standard part Hermitian matrix in the original ring, while the dual parts of the eigenvalues of that dual Hermitian matrix are the eigenvalues of those {supplement} matrices. Hence, by apply any practical method for computing eigenvalues of Hermitian matrices in the original ring, we have a practical method for computing eigenvalues of a dual Hermitian matrix. We call this method the supplement matrix method.Applications to low rank approximation and generalized inverses of dual matrices, dual least squares problem and formation control are discussed.Numerical experiments are reported.

Chernoff Information as a Privacy Constraint for Adversarial  Classification,"AyÅe Ãnsal, Melek Ãnen",Information Theory (cs.IT),"This work studies a privacy metric based on Chernoff information, \textit{Chernoff differential privacy}, due to its significance in characterization of classifier performance. Adversarial classification, as any other classification problem is built around minimization of the (average or correct detection) probability of error in deciding on either of the classes in the case of binary classification. Unlike the classical hypothesis testing problem, where the false alarm and mis-detection probabilities are handled separately resulting in an asymmetric behavior of the best error exponent, in this work, we focus on the Bayesian setting and characterize the relationship between the best error exponent of the average error probability and $\varepsilon-$differential privacy. Accordingly, we re-derive Chernoff differential privacy in terms of $\varepsilon-$differential privacy using the Radon-Nikodym derivative and show that it satisfies the composition property. Subsequently, we present numerical evaluation results, which demonstrates that Chernoff information outperforms Kullback-Leibler divergence as a function of the privacy parameter $\varepsilon$, the impact of the adversary's attack and global sensitivity for the problem of adversarial classification in Laplace mechanisms.
