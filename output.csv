"FAR: Flexible, Accurate and Robust 6DoF Relative Camera Pose Estimation",Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Chris Rockwell, Nilesh Kulkarni, Linyi Jin, Jeong Joon Park, Justin Johnson, David F. Fouhey","Abstract:Estimating relative camera poses between images has been a central problem in computer vision. Methods that find correspondences and solve for the fundamental matrix offer high precision in most cases. Conversely, methods predicting pose directly using neural networks are more robust to limited overlap and can infer absolute translation scale, but at the expense of reduced precision. We show how to combine the best of both methods; our approach yields results that are both precise and robust, while also accurately inferring translation scales. At the heart of our model lies a Transformer that (1) learns to balance between solved and learned pose estimations, and (2) provides a prior to guide a solver. A comprehensive analysis supports our design choices and demonstrates that our method adapts flexibly to various feature extractors and correspondence estimators, showing state-of-the-art performance in 6DoF pose estimation on Matterport3D, InteriorNet, StreetLearn, and Map-free Relocalization."
LC-Tsalis-INF: Generalized Best-of-Both-Worlds Linear Contextual Bandits,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"Masahiro Kato, Shinji Ito","Abstract:This study considers the linear contextual bandit problem with independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) contexts. In this problem, existing studies have proposed Best-of-Both-Worlds (BoBW) algorithms whose regrets satisfy $O(\log^2(T))$ for the number of rounds $T$ in a stochastic regime with a suboptimality gap lower-bounded by a positive constant, while satisfying $O(\sqrt{T})$ in an adversarial regime. However, the dependency on $T$ has room for improvement, and the suboptimality-gap assumption can be relaxed. For this issue, this study proposes an algorithm whose regret satisfies $O(\log(T))$ in the setting when the suboptimality gap is lower-bounded. Furthermore, we introduce a margin condition, a milder assumption on the suboptimality gap. That condition characterizes the problem difficulty linked to the suboptimality gap using a parameter $\beta \in (0, \infty]$. We then show that the algorithm's regret satisfies $O\left(\left\{\log(T)\right\}^{\frac{1+\beta}{2+\beta}}T^{\frac{1}{2+\beta}}\right)$. Here, $\beta= \infty$ corresponds to the case in the existing studies where a lower bound exists in the suboptimality gap, and our regret satisfies $O(\log(T))$ in that case. Our proposed algorithm is based on the Follow-The-Regularized-Leader with the Tsallis entropy and referred to as the $\alpha$-Linear-Contextual (LC)-Tsallis-INF."
The WMDP Benchmark: Measuring and Reducing Malicious Use With Unlearning,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Nathaniel Li, Alexander Pan, Anjali Gopal, Summer Yue, Daniel Berrios, Alice Gatti, Justin D.

Esvelt, Alexandr Wang,  et al. (1 additional author not shown)","Abstract:The White House Executive Order on Artificial Intelligence highlights the risks of large language models (LLMs) empowering malicious actors in developing biological, cyber, and chemical weapons. To measure these risks of malicious use, government institutions and major AI labs are developing evaluations for hazardous capabilities in LLMs. However, current evaluations are private, preventing further research into mitigating risk. Furthermore, they focus on only a few, highly specific pathways for malicious use. To fill these gaps, we publicly release the Weapons of Mass Destruction Proxy (WMDP) benchmark, a dataset of 4,157 multiple-choice questions that serve as a proxy measurement of hazardous knowledge in biosecurity, cybersecurity, and chemical security. WMDP was developed by a consortium of academics and technical consultants, and was stringently filtered to eliminate sensitive information prior to public release. WMDP serves two roles: first, as an evaluation for hazardous knowledge in LLMs, and second, as a benchmark for unlearning methods to remove such hazardous knowledge. To guide progress on unlearning, we develop CUT, a state-of-the-art unlearning method based on controlling model representations. CUT reduces model performance on WMDP while maintaining general capabilities in areas such as biology and computer science, suggesting that unlearning may be a concrete path towards reducing malicious use from LLMs. We release our benchmark and code publicly at this https URL"
Self-supervised 3D Patient Modeling with Multi-modal Attentive Fusion,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Meng Zheng, Benjamin Planche, Xuan Gong, Fan Yang, Terrence Chen, Ziyan Wu","Abstract:3D patient body modeling is critical to the success of automated patient positioning for smart medical scanning and operating rooms. Existing CNN-based end-to-end patient modeling solutions typically require a) customized network designs demanding large amount of relevant training data, covering extensive realistic clinical scenarios (e.g., patient covered by sheets), which leads to suboptimal generalizability in practical deployment, b) expensive 3D human model annotations, i.e., requiring huge amount of manual effort, resulting in systems that scale poorly. To address these issues, we propose a generic modularized 3D patient modeling method consists of (a) a multi-modal keypoint detection module with attentive fusion for 2D patient joint localization, to learn complementary cross-modality patient body information, leading to improved keypoint localization robustness and generalizability in a wide variety of imaging (e.g., CT, MRI etc.) and clinical scenarios (e.g., heavy occlusions); and (b) a self-supervised 3D mesh regression module which does not require expensive 3D mesh parameter annotations to train, bringing immediate cost benefits for clinical deployment. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method by extensive patient positioning experiments on both public and clinical data. Our evaluation results achieve superior patient positioning performance across various imaging modalities in real clinical scenarios."
A Safety-Critical Framework for UGVs in Complex Environments: A  Data-Driven Discrepancy-Aware Approach,Robotics (cs.RO),"Skylar X. Wei, Lu Gan, Joel W. Burdick","Abstract:This work presents a novel data-driven multi-layered planning and control framework for the safe navigation of a class of unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs) in the presence of unknown stationary obstacles and additive modeling uncertainties. The foundation of this framework is a novel robust model predictive planner, designed to generate optimal collision-free trajectories given an occupancy grid map, and a paired ancillary controller, augmented to provide robustness against model uncertainties extracted from learning data.
To tackle modeling discrepancies, we identify both matched (input discrepancies) and unmatched model residuals between the true and the nominal reduced-order models using closed-loop tracking errors as training data. Utilizing conformal prediction, we extract probabilistic upper bounds for the unknown model residuals, which serve to construct a robustifying ancillary controller. Further, we also determine maximum tracking discrepancies, also known as the robust control invariance tube, under the augmented policy, formulating them as collision buffers. Employing a LiDAR-based occupancy map to characterize the environment, we construct a discrepancy-aware cost map that incorporates these collision buffers. This map is then integrated into a sampling-based model predictive path planner that generates optimal and safe trajectories that can be robustly tracked by the augmented ancillary controller in the presence of model mismatches.
The effectiveness of the framework is experimentally validated for autonomous high-speed trajectory tracking in a cluttered environment with four different vehicle-terrain configurations. We also showcase the framework's versatility by reformulating it as a driver-assist program, providing collision avoidance corrections based on user joystick commands."
On the computation of lattice sums without translational invariance,Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Strongly Correlated Electrons (cond-mat.str-el); High Energy Physics - Lattice (hep-lat),"Andreas A. Buchheit, Torsten Ke√üler, Kirill Serkh","Abstract:This work introduces a framework for the efficient computation of oscillatory multidimensional lattice sums in geometries with boundaries, a problem intersecting pure and applied mathematics with immediate applications in condensed matter physics and topological quantum physics. The challenge in evaluating the arising sums results from the combination of singular long-range interactions with the loss of translational invariance caused by the boundaries, rendering standard tools ineffective. Our work shows that these lattice sums can be generated from a generalization of the Riemann zeta function to multidimensional non-periodic lattice sums. We put forth a new representation of this zeta function together with a numerical algorithm that ensures super-exponential convergence across an extensive range of geometries. Notably, our method's runtime is influenced only by the complexity of the considered geometries and not by the sheer number of particles, providing the foundation for efficient simulations of macroscopic condensed matter systems. We showcase the practical utility of our method by computing interaction energies in a three-dimensional crystal structure with $3\times 10^{23}$ particles. Our method's accuracy is thoroughly assessed through a detailed error analysis that both uses analytical results and numerical experiments. A reference implementation is provided online along with the article"
Scaling Rectified Flow Transformers for High-Resolution Image Synthesis,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Patrick Esser, Sumith Kulal, Andreas Blattmann, Rahim Entezari, Jonas M√ºller, Harry Saini, Yam Levi, Dominik Lorenz, Axel Sauer, Frederic Boesel, Dustin Podell, Tim Dockhorn, Zion English, Kyle Lacey, Alex Goodwin, Yannik Marek, Robin Rombach","Abstract:Diffusion models create data from noise by inverting the forward paths of data towards noise and have emerged as a powerful generative modeling technique for high-dimensional, perceptual data such as images and videos. Rectified flow is a recent generative model formulation that connects data and noise in a straight line. Despite its better theoretical properties and conceptual simplicity, it is not yet decisively established as standard practice. In this work, we improve existing noise sampling techniques for training rectified flow models by biasing them towards perceptually relevant scales. Through a large-scale study, we demonstrate the superior performance of this approach compared to established diffusion formulations for high-resolution text-to-image synthesis. Additionally, we present a novel transformer-based architecture for text-to-image generation that uses separate weights for the two modalities and enables a bidirectional flow of information between image and text tokens, improving text comprehension, typography, and human preference ratings. We demonstrate that this architecture follows predictable scaling trends and correlates lower validation loss to improved text-to-image synthesis as measured by various metrics and human evaluations. Our largest models outperform state-of-the-art models, and we will make our experimental data, code, and model weights publicly available."
CLEVR-POC: Reasoning-Intensive Visual Question Answering in Partially  Observable Environments,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Savitha Sam Abraham, Marjan Alirezaie, Luc De Raedt","Abstract:The integration of learning and reasoning is high on the research agenda in AI. Nevertheless, there is only a little attention to use existing background knowledge for reasoning about partially observed scenes to answer questions about the scene. Yet, we as humans use such knowledge frequently to infer plausible answers to visual questions (by eliminating all inconsistent ones). Such knowledge often comes in the form of constraints about objects and it tends to be highly domain or environment-specific. We contribute a novel benchmark called CLEVR-POC for reasoning-intensive visual question answering (VQA) in partially observable environments under constraints. In CLEVR-POC, knowledge in the form of logical constraints needs to be leveraged to generate plausible answers to questions about a hidden object in a given partial scene. For instance, if one has the knowledge that all cups are colored either red, green or blue and that there is only one green cup, it becomes possible to deduce the color of an occluded cup as either red or blue, provided that all other cups, including the green one, are observed. Through experiments, we observe that the low performance of pre-trained vision language models like CLIP (~ 22%) and a large language model (LLM) like GPT-4 (~ 46%) on CLEVR-POC ascertains the necessity for frameworks that can handle reasoning-intensive tasks where environment-specific background knowledge is available and crucial. Furthermore, our demonstration illustrates that a neuro-symbolic model, which integrates an LLM like GPT-4 with a visual perception network and a formal logical reasoner, exhibits exceptional performance on CLEVR-POC."

MAGID: An Automated Pipeline for Generating Synthetic Multi-modal  Datasets,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Hossein Aboutalebi, Hwanjun Song, Yusheng Xie, Arshit Gupta, Justin Sun, Hang Su, Igor Shalyminov, Nikolaos Pappas, Siffi Singh, Saab Mansour","Abstract:Development of multimodal interactive systems is hindered by the lack of rich, multimodal (text, images) conversational data, which is needed in large quantities for LLMs. Previous approaches augment textual dialogues with retrieved images, posing privacy, diversity, and quality constraints. In this work, we introduce \textbf{M}ultimodal \textbf{A}ugmented \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{I}mages \textbf{D}ialogues (MAGID), a framework to augment text-only dialogues with diverse and high-quality images. Subsequently, a diffusion model is applied to craft corresponding images, ensuring alignment with the identified text. Finally, MAGID incorporates an innovative feedback loop between an image description generation module (textual LLM) and image quality modules (addressing aesthetics, image-text matching, and safety), that work in tandem to generate high-quality and multi-modal dialogues. We compare MAGID to other SOTA baselines on three dialogue datasets, using automated and human evaluation. Our results show that MAGID is comparable to or better than baselines, with significant improvements in human evaluation, especially against retrieval baselines where the image database is small."
VeriEQL: Bounded Equivalence Verification for Complex SQL Queries with  Integrity Constraints,Programming Languages (cs.PL); Databases (cs.DB),"Yang He, Pinhan Zhao, Xinyu Wang, Yuepeng Wang","Abstract:The task of SQL query equivalence checking is important in various real-world applications (including query rewriting and automated grading) that involve complex queries with integrity constraints; yet, state-of-the-art techniques are very limited in their capability of reasoning about complex features (e.g., those that involve sorting, case statement, rich integrity constraints, etc.) in real-life queries. To the best of our knowledge, we propose the first SMT-based approach and its implementation, VeriEQL, capable of proving and disproving bounded equivalence of complex SQL queries. VeriEQL is based on a new logical encoding that models query semantics over symbolic tuples using the theory of integers with uninterpreted functions. It is simple yet highly practical -- our comprehensive evaluation on over 20,000 benchmarks shows that VeriEQL outperforms all state-of-the-art techniques by more than one order of magnitude in terms of the number of benchmarks that can be proved or disproved. VeriEQL can also generate counterexamples that facilitate many downstream tasks (such as finding serious bugs in systems like MySQL and Apache Calcite)."
Triple-CFN: Restructuring Conceptual Spaces for Enhancing Abstract  Reasoning process,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Ruizhuo Song, Beiming Yuan","Abstract:Abstract reasoning problems pose significant challenges to artificial intelligence algorithms, demanding cognitive capabilities beyond those required for perception tasks. This study introduces the Triple-CFN approach to tackle the Bongard-Logo problem, achieving notable reasoning accuracy by implicitly reorganizing the concept space of conflicting instances. Additionally, the Triple-CFN paradigm proves effective for the RPM problem with necessary modifications, yielding competitive results. To further enhance performance on the RPM issue, we develop the Meta Triple-CFN network, which explicitly structures the problem space while maintaining interpretability on progressive patterns. The success of Meta Triple-CFN is attributed to its paradigm of modeling the conceptual space, equivalent to normalizing reasoning information. Based on this ideology, we introduce the Re-space layer, enhancing the performance of both Meta Triple-CFN and Triple-CFN. This paper aims to contribute to advancements in machine intelligence by exploring innovative network designs for addressing abstract reasoning problems, paving the way for further breakthroughs in this domain."
Towards Democratized Flood Risk Management: An Advanced AI Assistant  Enabled by GPT-4 for Enhanced Interpretability and Public Engagement,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC),"Rafaela Martelo, Ruo-Qian Wang (Rutgers University)","Abstract:Real-time flood forecasting plays a crucial role in enabling timely and effective emergency responses. However, a significant challenge lies in bridging the gap between complex numerical flood models and practical decision-making. Decision-makers often rely on experts to interpret these models for optimizing flood mitigation strategies. And the public requires complex techniques to inquiry and understand socio-cultural and institutional factors, often hinders the public's understanding of flood risks. To overcome these challenges, our study introduces an innovative solution: a customized AI Assistant powered by the GPT-4 Large Language Model. This AI Assistant is designed to facilitate effective communication between decision-makers, the general public, and flood forecasters, without the requirement of specialized knowledge. The new framework utilizes GPT-4's advanced natural language understanding and function calling capabilities to provide immediate flood alerts and respond to various flood-related inquiries. Our developed prototype integrates real-time flood warnings with flood maps and social vulnerability data. It also effectively translates complex flood zone information into actionable risk management advice. To assess its performance, we evaluated the prototype using six criteria within three main categories: relevance, error resilience, and understanding of context. Our research marks a significant step towards a more accessible and user-friendly approach in flood risk management. This study highlights the potential of advanced AI tools like GPT-4 in democratizing information and enhancing public engagement in critical social and environmental issues."
"Reliable, Adaptable, and Attributable Language Models with Retrieval",Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Akari Asai, Zexuan Zhong, Danqi Chen, Pang Wei Koh, Luke Zettlemoyer, Hannaneh Hajishirzi, Wen-tau Yih","Abstract:Parametric language models (LMs), which are trained on vast amounts of web data, exhibit remarkable flexibility and capability. However, they still face practical challenges such as hallucinations, difficulty in adapting to new data distributions, and a lack of verifiability. In this position paper, we advocate for retrieval-augmented LMs to replace parametric LMs as the next generation of LMs. By incorporating large-scale datastores during inference, retrieval-augmented LMs can be more reliable, adaptable, and attributable. Despite their potential, retrieval-augmented LMs have yet to be widely adopted due to several obstacles: specifically, current retrieval-augmented LMs struggle to leverage helpful text beyond knowledge-intensive tasks such as question answering, have limited interaction between retrieval and LM components, and lack the infrastructure for scaling. To address these, we propose a roadmap for developing general-purpose retrieval-augmented LMs. This involves a reconsideration of datastores and retrievers, the exploration of pipelines with improved retriever-LM interaction, and significant investment in infrastructure for efficient training and inference."
Towards General Computer Control: A Multimodal Agent for Red Dead  Redemption II as a Case Study,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Weihao Tan, Ziluo Ding, Wentao Zhang, Boyu Li, Bohan Zhou, Junpeng Yue, Haochong Xia, Jiechuan Jiang, Longtao Zheng, Xinrun Xu, Yifei Bi, Pengjie Gu, Xinrun Wang, B√∂rje F. Karlsson, Bo An, Zongqing Lu","Abstract:Recent studies have demonstrated the success of foundation agents in specific tasks or scenarios. However, existing agents cannot generalize across different scenarios, mainly due to their diverse observation and action spaces and semantic gaps, or reliance on task-specific resources. In this work, we propose the General Computer Control (GCC) setting: building foundation agents that can master any computer task by taking only screen images (and possibly audio) of the computer as input, and producing keyboard and mouse operations as output, similar to human-computer interaction. To target GCC, we propose Cradle, an agent framework with strong reasoning abilities, including self-reflection, task inference, and skill curation, to ensure generalizability and self-improvement across various tasks. To demonstrate the capabilities of Cradle, we deploy it in the complex AAA game Red Dead Redemption II, serving as a preliminary attempt towards GCC with a challenging target. Our agent can follow the main storyline and finish real missions in this complex AAA game, with minimal reliance on prior knowledge and application-specific resources.

Preventing Reward Hacking with Occupancy Measure Regularization,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Cassidy Laidlaw, Shivam Singhal, Anca Dragan","Abstract:Reward hacking occurs when an agent performs very well with respect to a ""proxy"" reward function (which may be hand-specified or learned), but poorly with respect to the unknown true reward. Since ensuring good alignment between the proxy and true reward is extremely difficult, one approach to prevent reward hacking is optimizing the proxy conservatively. Prior work has particularly focused on enforcing the learned policy to behave similarly to a ""safe"" policy by penalizing the KL divergence between their action distributions (AD). However, AD regularization doesn't always work well since a small change in action distribution at a single state can lead to potentially calamitous outcomes, while large changes might not be indicative of any dangerous activity. Our insight is that when reward hacking, the agent visits drastically different states from those reached by the safe policy, causing large deviations in state occupancy measure (OM). Thus, we propose regularizing based on the OM divergence between policies instead of AD divergence to prevent reward hacking. We theoretically establish that OM regularization can more effectively avoid large drops in true reward. Then, we empirically demonstrate in a variety of realistic environments that OM divergence is superior to AD divergence for preventing reward hacking by regularizing towards a safe policy. Furthermore, we show that occupancy measure divergence can also regularize learned policies away from reward hacking behavior. Our code and data are available at this https URL"
How Well Can Transformers Emulate In-context Newton's Method?,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"Angeliki Giannou, Liu Yang, Tianhao Wang, Dimitris Papailiopoulos, Jason D. Lee","Abstract:Transformer-based models have demonstrated remarkable in-context learning capabilities, prompting extensive research into its underlying mechanisms. Recent studies have suggested that Transformers can implement first-order optimization algorithms for in-context learning and even second order ones for the case of linear regression. In this work, we study whether Transformers can perform higher order optimization methods, beyond the case of linear regression. We establish that linear attention Transformers with ReLU layers can approximate second order optimization algorithms for the task of logistic regression and achieve $\epsilon$ error with only a logarithmic to the error more layers. As a by-product we demonstrate the ability of even linear attention-only Transformers in implementing a single step of Newton's iteration for matrix inversion with merely two layers. These results suggest the ability of the Transformer architecture to implement complex algorithms, beyond gradient descent."
On the computation of stable coupled state-space models for dynamic  substructuring applications,Systems and Control (eess.SY); Dynamical Systems (math.DS),"R.S.O. Dias, M. Martarelli, P. Chiariotti","Abstract:This paper aims at introducing a methodology to compute stable coupled state-space models for dynamic substructuring applications by introducing two novel approaches targeted to accomplish this task: a) a procedure to impose Newtons's second law without relying on the use of undamped RCMs (residual compensation modes) and b) a novel approach to impose stability on unstable coupled state-space models. The enforcement of stability is performed by dividing the unstable model into two different models, one composed by the stable poles (stable model) and the other composed by the unstable ones (unstable model). Then, the poles of the unstable state-space model are forced to be stable, leading to the computation of a stabilized state-space model. Afterwards, to make sure that the Frequency Response Functions (FRFs) of the stabilized model well match the FRFs of the unstable model, the Least-Squares Frequency Domain (LSFD) method is exploited to update the modal parameters of the stabilized model composed by the pairs of complex conjugate poles. The validity of the proposed methodologies is presented and discussed by exploiting experimental data. Indeed, by exploiting the FRFs of a real system, accurate state-space models respecting Newton's second law are computed. Then, decoupling and coupling operations are performed with the identified state-space models, no matter the models resultant from the decoupling/coupling operations are unstable. Stability is then imposed on the computed unstable coupled model by following the approach proposed in this paper. The methodology proved to work well on these data. Moreover, the paper also shows that the coupled state-space models obtained using this methodology are suitable to be exploited in time-domain analyses and simulations."
Behavior Generation with Latent Actions,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Robotics (cs.RO),"Seungjae Lee, Yibin Wang, Haritheja Etukuru, H. Jin Kim, Nur Muhammad Mahi Shafiullah, Lerrel Pinto","Abstract:Generative modeling of complex behaviors from labeled datasets has been a longstanding problem in decision making. Unlike language or image generation, decision making requires modeling actions - continuous-valued vectors that are multimodal in their distribution, potentially drawn from uncurated sources, where generation errors can compound in sequential prediction. A recent class of models called Behavior Transformers (BeT) addresses this by discretizing actions using k-means clustering to capture different modes. However, k-means struggles to scale for high-dimensional action spaces or long sequences, and lacks gradient information, and thus BeT suffers in modeling long-range actions. In this work, we present Vector-Quantized Behavior Transformer (VQ-BeT), a versatile model for behavior generation that handles multimodal action prediction, conditional generation, and partial observations. VQ-BeT augments BeT by tokenizing continuous actions with a hierarchical vector quantization module. Across seven environments including simulated manipulation, autonomous driving, and robotics, VQ-BeT improves on state-of-the-art models such as BeT and Diffusion Policies. Importantly, we demonstrate VQ-BeT's improved ability to capture behavior modes while accelerating inference speed 5x over Diffusion Policies. Videos and code can be found this https URL"
Unifying and Certifying Top-Quality Planning,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Michael Katz, Junkyu Lee, Shirin Sohrabi","Abstract:The growing utilization of planning tools in practical scenarios has sparked an interest in generating multiple high-quality plans. Consequently, a range of computational problems under the general umbrella of top-quality planning were introduced over a short time period, each with its own definition. In this work, we show that the existing definitions can be unified into one, based on a dominance relation. The different computational problems, therefore, simply correspond to different dominance relations. Given the unified definition, we can now certify the top-quality of the solutions, leveraging existing certification of unsolvability and optimality. We show that task transformations found in the existing literature can be employed for the efficient certification of various top-quality planning problems and propose a novel transformation to efficiently certify loopless top-quality planning."
MOKA: Open-Vocabulary Robotic Manipulation through Mark-Based Visual  Prompting,Robotics (cs.RO); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Fangchen Liu, Kuan Fang, Pieter Abbeel, Sergey Levine","Abstract:Open-vocabulary generalization requires robotic systems to perform tasks involving complex and diverse environments and task goals. While the recent advances in vision language models (VLMs) present unprecedented opportunities to solve unseen problems, how to utilize their emergent capabilities to control robots in the physical world remains an open question. In this paper, we present MOKA (Marking Open-vocabulary Keypoint Affordances), an approach that employs VLMs to solve robotic manipulation tasks specified by free-form language descriptions. At the heart of our approach is a compact point-based representation of affordance and motion that bridges the VLM's predictions on RGB images and the robot's motions in the physical world. By prompting a VLM pre-trained on Internet-scale data, our approach predicts the affordances and generates the corresponding motions by leveraging the concept understanding and commonsense knowledge from broad sources. To scaffold the VLM's reasoning in zero-shot, we propose a visual prompting technique that annotates marks on the images, converting the prediction of keypoints and waypoints into a series of visual question answering problems that are feasible for the VLM to solve. Using the robot experiences collected in this way, we further investigate ways to bootstrap the performance through in-context learning and policy distillation. We evaluate and analyze MOKA's performance on a variety of manipulation tasks specified by free-form language descriptions, such as tool use, deformable body manipulation, and object rearrangement."
Solving the bongard-logo problem by modeling a probabilistic model,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Ruizhuo Song, Beiming Yuan","Abstract:Abstract reasoning problems challenge the perceptual and cognitive abilities of AI algorithms, demanding deeper pattern discernment and inductive reasoning beyond explicit image features. This study introduces PMoC, a tailored probability model for the Bongard-Logo problem, achieving high reasoning accuracy by constructing independent probability models. Additionally, we present Pose-Transformer, an enhanced Transformer-Encoder designed for complex abstract reasoning tasks, including Bongard-Logo, RAVEN, I-RAVEN, and PGM. Pose-Transformer incorporates positional information learning, inspired by capsule networks' pose matrices, enhancing its focus on local positional relationships in image data processing. When integrated with PMoC, it further improves reasoning accuracy. Our approach effectively addresses reasoning difficulties associated with abstract entities' positional changes, outperforming previous models on the OIG, D3$\times$3 subsets of RAVEN, and PGM databases. This research contributes to advancing AI's capabilities in abstract reasoning and cognitive pattern recognition."
Reaching Consensus in Cooperative Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning  with Goal Imagination,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Liangzhou Wang, Kaiwen Zhu, Fengming Zhu, Xinghu Yao, Shujie Zhang, Deheng Ye, Haobo Fu, Qiang Fu, Wei Yang","Abstract:Reaching consensus is key to multi-agent coordination. To accomplish a cooperative task, agents need to coherently select optimal joint actions to maximize the team reward. However, current cooperative multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) methods usually do not explicitly take consensus into consideration, which may cause miscoordination problem. In this paper, we propose a model-based consensus mechanism to explicitly coordinate multiple agents. The proposed Multi-agent Goal Imagination (MAGI) framework guides agents to reach consensus with an Imagined common goal. The common goal is an achievable state with high value, which is obtained by sampling from the distribution of future states. We directly model this distribution with a self-supervised generative model, thus alleviating the ""curse of dimensinality"" problem induced by multi-agent multi-step policy rollout commonly used in model-based methods. We show that such efficient consensus mechanism can guide all agents cooperatively reaching valuable future states. Results on Multi-agent Particle-Environments and Google Research Football environment demonstrate the superiority of MAGI in both sample efficiency and performance."
SNIFFER: Multimodal Large Language Model for Explainable Out-of-Context  Misinformation Detection,Multimedia (cs.MM); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL); Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Peng Qi, Zehong Yan, Wynne Hsu, Mong Li Lee","Abstract:Misinformation is a prevalent societal issue due to its potential high risks. Out-of-context (OOC) misinformation, where authentic images are repurposed with false text, is one of the easiest and most effective ways to mislead audiences. Current methods focus on assessing image-text consistency but lack convincing explanations for their judgments, which is essential for debunking misinformation. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have rich knowledge and innate capability for visual reasoning and explanation generation, they still lack sophistication in understanding and discovering the subtle crossmodal differences. In this paper, we introduce SNIFFER, a novel multimodal large language model specifically engineered for OOC misinformation detection and explanation. SNIFFER employs two-stage instruction tuning on InstructBLIP. The first stage refines the model's concept alignment of generic objects with news-domain entities and the second stage leverages language-only GPT-4 generated OOC-specific instruction data to fine-tune the model's discriminatory powers. Enhanced by external tools and retrieval, SNIFFER not only detects inconsistencies between text and image but also utilizes external knowledge for contextual verification. Our experiments show that SNIFFER surpasses the original MLLM by over 40% and outperforms state-of-the-art methods in detection accuracy. SNIFFER also provides accurate and persuasive explanations as validated by quantitative and human evaluations."
Learning Explicitly Conditioned Sparsifying Transforms,Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Optimization and Control (math.OC),"Andrei PƒÉtra≈ücu, Cristian Rusu, Paul Irofti","Abstract:Sparsifying transforms became in the last decades widely known tools for finding structured sparse representations of signals in certain transform domains. Despite the popularity of classical transforms such as DCT and Wavelet, learning optimal transforms that guarantee good representations of data into the sparse domain has been recently analyzed in a series of papers. Typically, the conditioning number and representation ability are complementary key features of learning square transforms that may not be explicitly controlled in a given optimization model. Unlike the existing approaches from the literature, in our paper, we consider a new sparsifying transform model that enforces explicit control over the data representation quality and the condition number of the learned transforms. We confirm through numerical experiments that our model presents better numerical behavior than the state-of-the-art."
PARADISE: Evaluating Implicit Planning Skills of Language Models with  Procedural Warnings and Tips Dataset,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Arda Uzunoƒülu, Abdalfatah Rashid Safa, G√∂zde G√ºl ≈ûahin","Abstract:Recently, there has been growing interest within the community regarding whether large language models are capable of planning or executing plans. However, most prior studies use LLMs to generate high-level plans for simplified scenarios lacking linguistic complexity and domain diversity, limiting analysis of their planning abilities. These setups constrain evaluation methods (e.g., predefined action space), architectural choices (e.g., only generative models), and overlook the linguistic nuances essential for realistic analysis. To tackle this, we present PARADISE, an abductive reasoning task using Q\&A format on practical procedural text sourced from wikiHow. It involves warning and tip inference tasks directly associated with goals, excluding intermediary steps, with the aim of testing the ability of the models to infer implicit knowledge of the plan solely from the given goal. Our experiments, utilizing fine-tuned language models and zero-shot prompting, reveal the effectiveness of task-specific small models over large language models in most scenarios. Despite advancements, all models fall short of human performance. Notably, our analysis uncovers intriguing insights, such as variations in model behavior with dropped keywords, struggles of BERT-family and GPT-4 with physical and abstract goals, and the proposed tasks offering valuable prior knowledge for other unseen procedural tasks. The PARADISE dataset and associated resources are publicly available for further research exploration with this https URL."
Leveraging Federated Learning and Edge Computing for Recommendation  Systems within Cloud Computing Networks,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Yaqian Qi, Yaqian Qi, Xiangxiang Wang, Hanzhe Li, Jingxiao Tian","Abstract:To enable large-scale and efficient deployment of artificial intelligence (AI), the combination of AI and edge computing has spawned Edge Intelligence, which leverages the computing and communication capabilities of end devices and edge servers to process data closer to where it is generated. A key technology for edge intelligence is the privacy-protecting machine learning paradigm known as Federated Learning (FL), which enables data owners to train models without having to transfer raw data to third-party servers. However, FL networks are expected to involve thousands of heterogeneous distributed devices. As a result, communication efficiency remains a key bottleneck. To reduce node failures and device exits, a Hierarchical Federated Learning (HFL) framework is proposed, where a designated cluster leader supports the data owner through intermediate model aggregation. Therefore, based on the improvement of edge server resource utilization, this paper can effectively make up for the limitation of cache capacity. In order to mitigate the impact of soft clicks on the quality of user experience (QoE), the authors model the user QoE as a comprehensive system cost. To solve the formulaic problem, the authors propose a decentralized caching algorithm with federated deep reinforcement learning (DRL) and federated learning (FL), where multiple agents learn and make decisions independently"
Design2Code: How Far Are We From Automating Front-End Engineering?,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Chenglei Si, Yanzhe Zhang, Zhengyuan Yang, Ruibo Liu, Diyi Yang","Abstract:Generative AI has made rapid advancements in recent years, achieving unprecedented capabilities in multimodal understanding and code generation. This can enable a new paradigm of front-end development, in which multimodal LLMs might directly convert visual designs into code implementations. In this work, we formalize this as a Design2Code task and conduct comprehensive benchmarking. Specifically, we manually curate a benchmark of 484 diverse real-world webpages as test cases and develop a set of automatic evaluation metrics to assess how well current multimodal LLMs can generate the code implementations that directly render into the given reference webpages, given the screenshots as input. We also complement automatic metrics with comprehensive human evaluations. We develop a suite of multimodal prompting methods and show their effectiveness on GPT-4V and Gemini Pro Vision. We further finetune an open-source Design2Code-18B model that successfully matches the performance of Gemini Pro Vision. Both human evaluation and automatic metrics show that GPT-4V performs the best on this task compared to other models. Moreover, annotators think GPT-4V generated webpages can replace the original reference webpages in 49% of cases in terms of visual appearance and content; and perhaps surprisingly, in 64% of cases GPT-4V generated webpages are considered better than the original reference webpages. Our fine-grained break-down metrics indicate that open-source models mostly lag in recalling visual elements from the input webpages and in generating correct layout designs, while aspects like text content and coloring can be drastically improved with proper finetuning."
PalmProbNet: A Probabilistic Approach to Understanding Palm  Distributions in Ecuadorian Tropical Forest via Transfer Learning,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Kangning Cui, Zishan Shao, Gregory Larsen, Victor Pauca, Sarra Alqahtani, David Segurado, Jo√£o Pinheiro, Manqi Wang, David Lutz, Robert Plemmons, Miles Silman","Abstract:Palms play an outsized role in tropical forests and are important resources for humans and wildlife. A central question in tropical ecosystems is understanding palm distribution and abundance. However, accurately identifying and localizing palms in geospatial imagery presents significant challenges due to dense vegetation, overlapping canopies, and variable lighting conditions in mixed-forest landscapes. Addressing this, we introduce PalmProbNet, a probabilistic approach utilizing transfer learning to analyze high-resolution UAV-derived orthomosaic imagery, enabling the detection of palm trees within the dense canopy of the Ecuadorian Rainforest. This approach represents a substantial advancement in automated palm detection, effectively pinpointing palm presence and locality in mixed tropical rainforests. Our process begins by generating an orthomosaic image from UAV images, from which we extract and label palm and non-palm image patches in two distinct sizes. These patches are then used to train models with an identical architecture, consisting of an unaltered pre-trained ResNet-18 and a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) with specifically trained parameters. Subsequently, PalmProbNet employs a sliding window technique on the landscape orthomosaic, using both small and large window sizes to generate a probability heatmap. This heatmap effectively visualizes the distribution of palms, showcasing the scalability and adaptability of our approach in various forest densities. Despite the challenging terrain, our method demonstrated remarkable performance, achieving an accuracy of 97.32% and a Cohen's kappa of 94.59% in testing."
Rethinking Clustered Federated Learning in NOMA Enhanced Wireless  Networks,Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Information Theory (cs.IT); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Yushen Lin, Kaidi Wang, Zhiguo Ding","Abstract:This study explores the benefits of integrating the novel clustered federated learning (CFL) approach with non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) under non-independent and identically distributed (non-IID) datasets, where multiple devices participate in the aggregation with time limitations and a finite number of sub-channels. A detailed theoretical analysis of the generalization gap that measures the degree of non-IID in the data distribution is presented. Following that, solutions to address the challenges posed by non-IID conditions are proposed with the analysis of the properties. Specifically, users' data distributions are parameterized as concentration parameters and grouped using spectral clustering, with Dirichlet distribution serving as the prior. The investigation into the generalization gap and convergence rate guides the design of sub-channel assignments through the matching-based algorithm, and the power allocation is achieved by Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions with the derived closed-form solution. The extensive simulation results show that the proposed cluster-based FL framework can outperform FL baselines in terms of both test accuracy and convergence rate. Moreover, jointly optimizing sub-channel and power allocation in NOMA-enhanced networks can lead to a significant improvement."
Deep-Learned Compression for Radio-Frequency Signal Classification,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI); Signal Processing (eess.SP),"Armani Rodriguez, Yagna Kaasaragadda, Silvija Kokalj-Filipovic","Abstract:Next-generation cellular concepts rely on the processing of large quantities of radio-frequency (RF) samples. This includes Radio Access Networks (RAN) connecting the cellular front-end based on software defined radios (SDRs) and a framework for the AI processing of spectrum-related data. The RF data collected by the dense RAN radio units and spectrum sensors may need to be jointly processed for intelligent decision making. Moving large amounts of data to AI agents may result in significant bandwidth and latency costs. We propose a deep learned compression (DLC) model, HQARF, based on learned vector quantization (VQ), to compress the complex-valued samples of RF signals comprised of 6 modulation classes. We are assessing the effects of HQARF on the performance of an AI model trained to infer the modulation class of the RF signal. Compression of narrow-band RF samples for the training and off-the-site inference will allow for an efficient use of the bandwidth and storage for non-real-time analytics, and for a decreased delay in real-time applications. While exploring the effectiveness of the HQARF signal reconstructions in modulation classification tasks, we highlight the DLC optimization space and some open problems related to the training of the VQ embedded in HQARF."
Robust Federated Learning Mitigates Client-side Training Data  Distribution Inference Attacks,"Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Distributed, Parallel, and Cluster Computing (cs.DC); Machine Learning (cs.LG)","Yichang Xu, Ming Yin, Minghong Fang, Neil Zhenqiang Gong","Abstract:Recent studies have revealed that federated learning (FL), once considered secure due to clients not sharing their private data with the server, is vulnerable to attacks such as client-side training data distribution inference, where a malicious client can recreate the victim's data. While various countermeasures exist, they are not practical, often assuming server access to some training data or knowledge of label distribution before the attack.
In this work, we bridge the gap by proposing InferGuard, a novel Byzantine-robust aggregation rule aimed at defending against client-side training data distribution inference attacks. In our proposed InferGuard, the server first calculates the coordinate-wise median of all the model updates it receives. A client's model update is considered malicious if it significantly deviates from the computed median update. We conduct a thorough evaluation of our proposed InferGuard on five benchmark datasets and perform a comparison with ten baseline methods. The results of our experiments indicate that our defense mechanism is highly effective in protecting against client-side training data distribution inference attacks, even against strong adaptive attacks. Furthermore, our method substantially outperforms the baseline methods in various practical FL scenarios."
Dual Mean-Teacher: An Unbiased Semi-Supervised Framework for  Audio-Visual Source Localization,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Multimedia (cs.MM); Sound (cs.SD); Audio and Speech Processing (eess.AS),"Yuxin Guo, Shijie Ma, Hu Su, Zhiqing Wang, Yuhao Zhao, Wei Zou, Siyang Sun, Yun Zheng","Abstract:Audio-Visual Source Localization (AVSL) aims to locate sounding objects within video frames given the paired audio clips. Existing methods predominantly rely on self-supervised contrastive learning of audio-visual correspondence. Without any bounding-box annotations, they struggle to achieve precise localization, especially for small objects, and suffer from blurry boundaries and false positives. Moreover, the naive semi-supervised method is poor in fully leveraging the information of abundant unlabeled data. In this paper, we propose a novel semi-supervised learning framework for AVSL, namely Dual Mean-Teacher (DMT), comprising two teacher-student structures to circumvent the confirmation bias issue. Specifically, two teachers, pre-trained on limited labeled data, are employed to filter out noisy samples via the consensus between their predictions, and then generate high-quality pseudo-labels by intersecting their confidence maps. The sufficient utilization of both labeled and unlabeled data and the proposed unbiased framework enable DMT to outperform current state-of-the-art methods by a large margin, with CIoU of 90.4% and 48.8% on Flickr-SoundNet and VGG-Sound Source, obtaining 8.9%, 9.6% and 4.6%, 6.4% improvements over self- and semi-supervised methods respectively, given only 3% positional-annotations. We also extend our framework to some existing AVSL methods and consistently boost their performance."
Language Guided Exploration for RL Agents in Text Environments,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Hitesh Golchha, Sahil Yerawar, Dhruvesh Patel, Soham Dan, Keerthiram Murugesan","Abstract:Real-world sequential decision making is characterized by sparse rewards and large decision spaces, posing significant difficulty for experiential learning systems like $\textit{tabula rasa}$ reinforcement learning (RL) agents. Large Language Models (LLMs), with a wealth of world knowledge, can help RL agents learn quickly and adapt to distribution shifts. In this work, we introduce Language Guided Exploration (LGE) framework, which uses a pre-trained language model (called GUIDE ) to provide decision-level guidance to an RL agent (called EXPLORER). We observe that on ScienceWorld (Wang et al.,2022), a challenging text environment, LGE outperforms vanilla RL agents significantly and also outperforms other sophisticated methods like Behaviour Cloning and Text Decision Transformer."
Simplicity in Complexity,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Neurons and Cognition (q-bio.NC),"Kevin Shen, Surabhi S Nath, Aenne Brielmann, Peter Dayan","Abstract:The complexity of visual stimuli plays an important role in many cognitive phenomena, including attention, engagement, memorability, time perception and aesthetic evaluation. Despite its importance, complexity is poorly understood and ironically, previous models of image complexity have been quite \textit{complex}. There have been many attempts to find handcrafted features that explain complexity, but these features are usually dataset specific, and hence fail to generalise. On the other hand, more recent work has employed deep neural networks to predict complexity, but these models remain difficult to interpret, and do not guide a theoretical understanding of the problem. Here we propose to model complexity using segment-based representations of images. We use state-of-the-art segmentation models, SAM and FC-CLIP, to quantify the number of segments at multiple granularities, and the number of classes in an image respectively. We find that complexity is well-explained by a simple linear model with these two features across six diverse image-sets of naturalistic scene and art images. This suggests that the complexity of images can be surprisingly simple."
CoGenesis: A Framework Collaborating Large and Small Language Models for  Secure Context-Aware Instruction Following,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Kaiyan Zhang, Jianyu Wang, Ermo Hua, Biqing Qi, Ning Ding, Bowen Zhou","Abstract:With the advancement of language models (LMs), their exposure to private data is increasingly inevitable, and their deployment (especially for smaller ones) on personal devices, such as PCs and smartphones, has become a prevailing trend. In contexts laden with user information, enabling models to both safeguard user privacy and execute commands efficiently emerges as an essential research imperative. In this paper, we propose CoGenesis, a collaborative generation framework integrating large (hosted on cloud infrastructure) and small models (deployed on local devices) to address privacy concerns logically. Initially, we design a pipeline to create personalized writing instruction datasets enriched with extensive context details as the testbed of this research issue. Subsequently, we introduce two variants of CoGenesis based on sketch and logits respectively. Our experimental findings, based on our synthesized dataset and two additional open-source datasets, indicate that: 1) Large-scale models perform well when provided with user context but struggle in the absence of such context. 2) While specialized smaller models fine-tuned on the synthetic dataset show promise, they still lag behind their larger counterparts. 3) Our CoGenesis framework, utilizing mixed-scale models, showcases competitive performance, providing a feasible solution to privacy issues."
A Federated Deep Learning Approach for Privacy-Preserving Real-Time  Transient Stability Predictions in Power Systems,Systems and Control (eess.SY),"Maeshal Hijazi, Payman Dehghanian","Abstract:Maintaining the privacy of power system data is essential for protecting sensitive information and ensuring the operation security of critical infrastructure. Therefore, the adoption of centralized deep learning (DL) transient stability assessment (TSA) frameworks can introduce risks to electric utilities. This is because these frameworks make utility data susceptible to cyber threats and communication issues when transmitting data to a central server for training a single TSA model. Additionally, the centralized approach demands significant computational resources, which may not always be readily available. In light of these challenges, this paper introduces a federated DL-based TSA framework designed to identify the operating states of the power system. Instead of local utilities transmitting their data to a central server for centralized model training, they independently train their own TSA models using their respective datasets. Subsequently, the parameters of each local TSA model are sent to a central server for model aggregation, and the resulting model is shared back with the local clients. This approach not only preserves the integrity of local utility data, making it resilient against cyber threats but also reduces the computational demands for local TSA model training. The proposed approach is tested on four local clients each having the IEEE 39-bus test system."
NRDF: Neural Riemannian Distance Fields for Learning Articulated Pose  Priors,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Yannan He, Garvita Tiwari, Tolga Birdal, Jan Eric Lenssen, Gerard Pons-Moll","Abstract:Faithfully modeling the space of articulations is a crucial task that allows recovery and generation of realistic poses, and remains a notorious challenge. To this end, we introduce Neural Riemannian Distance Fields (NRDFs), data-driven priors modeling the space of plausible articulations, represented as the zero-level-set of a neural field in a high-dimensional product-quaternion space. To train NRDFs only on positive examples, we introduce a new sampling algorithm, ensuring that the geodesic distances follow a desired distribution, yielding a principled distance field learning paradigm. We then devise a projection algorithm to map any random pose onto the level-set by an adaptive-step Riemannian optimizer, adhering to the product manifold of joint rotations at all times. NRDFs can compute the Riemannian gradient via backpropagation and by mathematical analogy, are related to Riemannian flow matching, a recent generative model. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of NRDF against other pose priors in various downstream tasks, i.e., pose generation, image-based pose estimation, and solving inverse kinematics, highlighting NRDF's superior performance. Besides humans, NRDF's versatility extends to hand and animal poses, as it can effectively represent any articulation."
"Angry Men, Sad Women: Large Language Models Reflect Gendered Stereotypes  in Emotion Attribution",Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Flor Miriam Plaza-del-Arco, Amanda Cercas Curry, Alba Curry, Gavin Abercrombie, Dirk Hovy","Abstract:Large language models (LLMs) reflect societal norms and biases, especially about gender. While societal biases and stereotypes have been extensively researched in various NLP applications, there is a surprising gap for emotion analysis. However, emotion and gender are closely linked in societal discourse. E.g., women are often thought of as more empathetic, while men's anger is more socially accepted. To fill this gap, we present the first comprehensive study of gendered emotion attribution in five state-of-the-art LLMs (open- and closed-source). We investigate whether emotions are gendered, and whether these variations are based on societal stereotypes. We prompt the models to adopt a gendered persona and attribute emotions to an event like 'When I had a serious argument with a dear person'. We then analyze the emotions generated by the models in relation to the gender-event pairs. We find that all models consistently exhibit gendered emotions, influenced by gender stereotypes. These findings are in line with established research in psychology and gender studies. Our study sheds light on the complex societal interplay between language, gender, and emotion. The reproduction of emotion stereotypes in LLMs allows us to use those models to study the topic in detail, but raises questions about the predictive use of those same LLMs for emotion applications."

Applying a segmentation network to a medical video processing task can introduce significant inter-frame prediction noise. Existing approaches can reduce inconsistencies by including temporal information but often impose requirements on the architecture or dataset. This paper proposes a method to include temporal information in any segmentation model and, thus, a technique to improve video segmentation performance without alterations during training or additional labeling. With Motion-Corrected Moving Average, we refine the exponential moving average between the current and previous predictions. Using optical flow to estimate the movement between consecutive frames, we can shift the prior term in the moving-average calculation to align with the geometry of the current frame. The optical flow calculation does not require the output of the model and can therefore be performed in parallel, leading to no significant runtime penalty for our approach. We evaluate our approach on two publicly available segmentation datasets and two proprietary endoscopic datasets and show improvements over a baseline approach."
Necessary and Sufficient Conditions to the Problem of Input-Output  Extension of Internally Controlled Underactuated Nonlinear Systems,Systems and Control (eess.SY),"Mirko Mizzoni, Amr Afifi, Antonio Franchi","Abstract:In this letter, we address the problem of re-targeting a commercial under-actuated robotic system to a higher dimensional output task. Commercial platforms are equipped with an on-board low-level internal controller that provides the user some virtual references inputs and cannot be replaced. Such controller may control in practice only a subset of the total degrees-of-freedom of the system. Our primary objective is to augment these systems by introducing supplementary inputs, attaining increased output capability. Integrating such additional inputs into the control framework introduces a layer of complexity, raising questions about the compatibility and cohesiveness of the overall system. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which it is possible to extend the controlled outputs by adding extra inputs when one is forced to keep the internal controller unmodified. We underscore the efficacy and universality of our proposed methodology through the presentation of two relevant examples."
Equilibria in Two-Stage Facility Location with Atomic Clients,Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Simon Krogmann, Pascal Lenzner, Alexander Skopalik, Marc Uetz, Marnix C. Vos","Abstract:We consider competitive facility location as a two-stage multi-agent system with two types of clients. For a given host graph with weighted clients on the vertices, first facility agents strategically select vertices for opening their facilities. Then, the clients strategically select which of the opened facilities in their neighborhood to patronize. Facilities want to attract as much client weight as possible, clients want to minimize congestion on the chosen facility.
All recently studied versions of this model assume that clients can split their weight strategically. We consider clients with unsplittable weights, but allow mixed strategies. So clients may randomize over which facility to patronize. Besides modeling a natural client behavior, this subtle change yields drastic changes, e.g., for a given facility placement, qualitatively different client equilibria are possible.
As our main result, we show that pure subgame perfect equilibria always exist if all client weights are identical. For this, we use a novel potential function argument, employing a hierarchical classification of the clients and sophisticated rounding in each step. In contrast, for non-identical clients, we show that deciding the existence of even approximately stable states is computationally intractable. On the positive side, we give a tight bound of 2 on the price of anarchy which implies high social welfare of equilibria, if they exist."
Improved LiDAR Odometry and Mapping using Deep Semantic Segmentation and  Novel Outliers Detection,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Robotics (cs.RO),"Mohamed Afifi, Mohamed ElHelw","Abstract:Perception is a key element for enabling intelligent autonomous navigation. Understanding the semantics of the surrounding environment and accurate vehicle pose estimation are essential capabilities for autonomous vehicles, including self-driving cars and mobile robots that perform complex tasks. Fast moving platforms like self-driving cars impose a hard challenge for localization and mapping algorithms. In this work, we propose a novel framework for real-time LiDAR odometry and mapping based on LOAM architecture for fast moving platforms. Our framework utilizes semantic information produced by a deep learning model to improve point-to-line and point-to-plane matching between LiDAR scans and build a semantic map of the environment, leading to more accurate motion estimation using LiDAR data. We observe that including semantic information in the matching process introduces a new type of outlier matches to the process, where matching occur between different objects of the same semantic class. To this end, we propose a novel algorithm that explicitly identifies and discards potential outliers in the matching process. In our experiments, we study the effect of improving the matching process on the robustness of LiDAR odometry against high speed motion. Our experimental evaluations on KITTI dataset demonstrate that utilizing semantic information and rejecting outliers significantly enhance the robustness of LiDAR odometry and mapping when there are large gaps between scan acquisition poses, which is typical for fast moving platforms."

Biomechanical Comparison of Human Walking Locomotion on Solid Ground and  Sand,Robotics (cs.RO),"Chunchu Zhu, Xunjie Chen, Jingang Yi","Abstract:Current studies on human locomotion focus mainly on solid ground walking conditions. In this paper, we present a biomechanic comparison of human walking locomotion on solid ground and sand. A novel dataset containing 3-dimensional motion and biomechanical data from 20 able-bodied adults for locomotion on solid ground and sand is collected. We present the data collection methods and report the sensor data along with the kinematic and kinetic profiles of joint biomechanics. A comprehensive analysis of human gait and joint stiffness profiles is presented. The kinematic and kinetic analysis reveals that human walking locomotion on sand shows different ground reaction forces and joint torque profiles, compared with those patterns from walking on solid ground. These gait differences reflect that humans adopt motion control strategies for yielding terrain conditions such as sand. The dataset also provides a source of locomotion data for researchers to study human activity recognition and assistive devices for walking on different terrains."
Emergent Equivariance in Deep Ensembles,Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Jan E. Gerken, Pan Kessel","Abstract:We demonstrate that deep ensembles are secretly equivariant models. More precisely, we show that deep ensembles become equivariant for all inputs and at all training times by simply using data augmentation. Crucially, equivariance holds off-manifold and for any architecture in the infinite width limit. The equivariance is emergent in the sense that predictions of individual ensemble members are not equivariant but their collective prediction is. Neural tangent kernel theory is used to derive this result and we verify our theoretical insights using detailed numerical experiments."

This inadequacy primarily stems from the lack of built-in action knowledge in language agents, which fails to effectively guide the planning trajectories during task solving and results in planning hallucination. To address this issue, we introduce KnowAgent, a novel approach designed to enhance the planning capabilities of LLMs by incorporating explicit action knowledge. Specifically, KnowAgent employs an action knowledge base and a knowledgeable self-learning strategy to constrain the action path during planning, enabling more reasonable trajectory synthesis, and thereby enhancing the planning performance of language agents. Experimental results on HotpotQA and ALFWorld based on various backbone models demonstrate that KnowAgent can achieve comparable or superior performance to existing baselines. Further analysis indicates the effectiveness of KnowAgent in terms of planning hallucinations mitigation. Code is available in this https URL."

In our work, we focus on semi-supervised AVSL with pseudo-labeling. To address the issues with vanilla hard pseudo-labels including bias accumulation, noise sensitivity, and instability, we propose a novel method named Cross Pseudo-Labeling (XPL), wherein two models learn from each other with the cross-refine mechanism to avoid bias accumulation. We equip XPL with two effective components. Firstly, the soft pseudo-labels with sharpening and pseudo-label exponential moving average mechanisms enable models to achieve gradual self-improvement and ensure stable training. Secondly, the curriculum data selection module adaptively selects pseudo-labels with high quality during training to mitigate potential bias. Experimental results demonstrate that XPL significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance while effectively mitigating confirmation bias and ensuring training stability."
Tooling Offline Runtime Verification against Interaction Models :  recognizing sliced behaviors using parameterized simulation,Software Engineering (cs.SE),"Erwan Mahe, Boutheina Bannour, Christophe Gaston, Arnault Lapitre, Pascale Le Gall","Abstract:Offline runtime verification involves the static analysis of executions of a system against a specification. For distributed systems, it is generally not possible to characterize executions in the form of global traces, given the absence of a global clock. To account for this, we model executions as collections of local traces called multi-traces, with one local trace per group of co-localized actors that share a common clock. Due to the difficulty of synchronizing the start and end of the recordings of local traces, events may be missing at their beginning or end. Considering such partially observed multi-traces is challenging for runtime verification. To that end, we propose an algorithm that verifies the conformity of such traces against formal specifications called Interactions (akin to Message Sequence Charts). It relies on parameterized simulation to reconstitute unobserved behaviors."
Recall-Oriented Continual Learning with Generative Adversarial  Meta-Model,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Haneol Kang, Dong-Wan Choi","Abstract:The stability-plasticity dilemma is a major challenge in continual learning, as it involves balancing the conflicting objectives of maintaining performance on previous tasks while learning new tasks. In this paper, we propose the recall-oriented continual learning framework to address this challenge. Inspired by the human brain's ability to separate the mechanisms responsible for stability and plasticity, our framework consists of a two-level architecture where an inference network effectively acquires new knowledge and a generative network recalls past knowledge when necessary. In particular, to maximize the stability of past knowledge, we investigate the complexity of knowledge depending on different representations, and thereby introducing generative adversarial meta-model (GAMM) that incrementally learns task-specific parameters instead of input data samples of the task. Through our experiments, we show that our framework not only effectively learns new knowledge without any disruption but also achieves high stability of previous knowledge in both task-aware and task-agnostic learning scenarios.

Fast and robust method for screened Poisson lattice Green's function  using asymptotic expansion and Fast Fourier Transform,Numerical Analysis (math.NA); Computational Physics (physics.comp-ph),"Wei Hou, Tim Colonius","Abstract:We study the lattice Green's function (LGF) of the screened Poisson equation on a two-dimensional rectangular lattice. This LGF arises in numerical analysis, random walks, solid-state physics, and other fields. Its defining characteristic is the screening term, which defines different regimes. When its coefficient is large, we can accurately approximate the LGF with an exponentially converging asymptotic expansion, and its convergence rate monotonically increases with the coefficient of the screening term. To tabulate the LGF when the coefficient is not large, we derive a one-dimensional integral representation of the LGF. We show that the trapezoidal rule can approximate this integral with exponential convergence, and we propose an efficient algorithm for its evaluation via the Fast Fourier Transform. We discuss applications including computing the LGF of the three-dimensional Poisson equation with one periodic direction and the return probability of a two-dimensional random walk with killing."
Detecting Concrete Visual Tokens for Multimodal Machine Translation,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Braeden Bowen, Vipin Vijayan, Scott Grigsby, Timothy Anderson, Jeremy Gwinnup","Abstract:The challenge of visual grounding and masking in multimodal machine translation (MMT) systems has encouraged varying approaches to the detection and selection of visually-grounded text tokens for masking. We introduce new methods for detection of visually and contextually relevant (concrete) tokens from source sentences, including detection with natural language processing (NLP), detection with object detection, and a joint detection-verification technique. We also introduce new methods for selection of detected tokens, including shortest $n$ tokens, longest $n$ tokens, and all detected concrete tokens. We utilize the GRAM MMT architecture to train models against synthetically collated multimodal datasets of source images with masked sentences, showing performance improvements and improved usage of visual context during translation tasks over the baseline model."
Improving Variational Autoencoder Estimation from Incomplete Data with  Mixture Variational Families,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Machine Learning (stat.ML),"Vaidotas Simkus, Michael U. Gutmann","Abstract:We consider the task of estimating variational autoencoders (VAEs) when the training data is incomplete. We show that missing data increases the complexity of the model's posterior distribution over the latent variables compared to the fully-observed case. The increased complexity may adversely affect the fit of the model due to a mismatch between the variational and model posterior distributions. We introduce two strategies based on (i) finite variational-mixture and (ii) imputation-based variational-mixture distributions to address the increased posterior complexity. Through a comprehensive evaluation of the proposed approaches, we show that variational mixtures are effective at improving the accuracy of VAE estimation from incomplete data."
Enumeration for MSO-Queries on Compressed Trees,Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL); Databases (cs.DB),"Markus Lohrey, Markus L. Schmid",Abstract:We present a linear preprocessing and output-linear delay enumeration algorithm for MSO-queries over trees that are compressed in the well-established grammar-based framework. Time bounds are measured with respect to the size of the compressed representation of the tree. Our result extends previous work on the enumeration of MSO-queries over uncompressed trees and on the enumeration of document spanners over compressed text documents.
Tracking-in-range Formulations for Numerical Optimal Control,Systems and Control (eess.SY),"Nikilesh Ramesh, Eric C. Kerrigan, Yuanbo Nie","Abstract:In contrast to set-point tracking which aims to reduce the tracking error between the tracker and the reference, tracking-in-range problems only focus on whether the tracker is within a given range around the reference, making it more suitable for the mission specifications of many practical applications. In this work, we present novel optimal control formulations to solve tracking-in-range problems, for both problems requiring the tracker to be always in range, and problems allowing the tracker to go out of range to yield overall better outcomes. As the problem naturally involves discontinuous functions, we present alternative formulations and regularisation strategies to improve the performance of numerical solvers. The extension to in-range tracking with multiple trackers and in-range tracking in high dimensional space are also discussed and illustrated with numerical examples, demonstrating substantial increases in mission duration in comparison to traditional set-point tracking."
CrackNex: a Few-shot Low-light Crack Segmentation Model Based on Retinex  Theory for UAV Inspections,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Zhen Yao, Jiawei Xu, Shuhang Hou, Mooi Choo Chuah","Abstract:Routine visual inspections of concrete structures are imperative for upholding the safety and integrity of critical infrastructure. Such visual inspections sometimes happen under low-light conditions, e.g., checking for bridge health. Crack segmentation under such conditions is challenging due to the poor contrast between cracks and their surroundings. However, most deep learning methods are designed for well-illuminated crack images and hence their performance drops dramatically in low-light scenes. In addition, conventional approaches require many annotated low-light crack images which is time-consuming. In this paper, we address these challenges by proposing CrackNex, a framework that utilizes reflectance information based on Retinex Theory to help the model learn a unified illumination-invariant representation. Furthermore, we utilize few-shot segmentation to solve the inefficient training data problem. In CrackNex, both a support prototype and a reflectance prototype are extracted from the support set. Then, a prototype fusion module is designed to integrate the features from both prototypes. CrackNex outperforms the SOTA methods on multiple datasets. Additionally, we present the first benchmark dataset, LCSD, for low-light crack segmentation. LCSD consists of 102 well-illuminated crack images and 41 low-light crack images. The dataset and code are available at this https URL."
When Industry meets Trustworthy AI: A Systematic Review of AI for  Industry 5.0,Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Eduardo Vyhmeister, Gabriel G. Castane","Abstract:Industry is at the forefront of adopting new technologies, and the process followed by the adoption has a significant impact on the economy and society. In this work, we focus on analysing the current paradigm in which industry evolves, making it more sustainable and Trustworthy. In Industry 5.0, Artificial Intelligence (AI), among other technology enablers, is used to build services from a sustainable, human-centric and resilient perspective. It is crucial to understand those aspects that can bring AI to industry, respecting Trustworthy principles by collecting information to define how it is incorporated in the early stages, its impact, and the trends observed in the field. In addition, to understand the challenges and gaps in the transition from Industry 4.0 to Industry 5.0, a general perspective on the industry's readiness for new technologies is described. This provides practitioners with novel opportunities to be explored in pursuit of the adoption of Trustworthy AI in the sector."
Efficient Interaction-Based Offline Runtime Verification of Distributed  Systems with Lifeline Removal,Formal Languages and Automata Theory (cs.FL),"Erwan Mahe, Boutheina Bannour, Christophe Gaston, Pascale Le Gall","Abstract:Runtime Verification (RV) refers to a family of techniques in which system executions are observed and confronted to formal specifications, with the aim of identifying faults. In Offline RV, observation is done in a first step and verification in a second, on a static artifact collected during observation. In this paper, we define an approach to offline RV of Distributed Systems (DS) against interactions. Interactions are formal models describing communications within a DS. DS are composed of subsystems deployed on different machines and interacting via message passing. Therefore, observing executions of a DS entails logging a collection of local execution traces, one for each subsystem, that we call a multi-trace. A major challenge in analyzing multi-traces is that there are no practical means to synchronize the ends of observations of all local traces. We address this via an operation, called lifeline removal, which we apply on-the-fly on the specification during verification once a local trace has been entirely analyzed. This operation removes from the interaction the specification of actions occurring on the subsystem that is no-longer observed. This may allow further execution of the specification via removing deadlocks due to the partial orders of actions. We prove the correctness of the resulting RV algorithm and introduce two optimization techniques which we also prove correct. We implement a Partial Order Reduction (POR) technique via the selection of a one-unambiguous action (as a unique first step to a linearization) which existence is determined via another use of the lifeline removal operator. Additionally, Local Analyses (LOC) i.e., the verification of local traces, can be leveraged during the global multi-trace analysis to prove failure more quickly. Experiments illustrate the application of our RV approach and the benefits of our optimizations."
Distributed Policy Gradient for Linear Quadratic Networked Control with  Limited Communication Range,Multiagent Systems (cs.MA); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Robotics (cs.RO); Systems and Control (eess.SY),"Yuzi Yan, Yuan Shen","Abstract:This paper proposes a scalable distributed policy gradient method and proves its convergence to near-optimal solution in multi-agent linear quadratic networked systems. The agents engage within a specified network under local communication constraints, implying that each agent can only exchange information with a limited number of neighboring agents. On the underlying graph of the network, each agent implements its control input depending on its nearby neighbors' states in the linear quadratic control setting. We show that it is possible to approximate the exact gradient only using local information. Compared with the centralized optimal controller, the performance gap decreases to zero exponentially as the communication and control ranges increase. We also demonstrate how increasing the communication range enhances system stability in the gradient descent process, thereby elucidating a critical trade-off. The simulation results verify our theoretical findings."
Design of Stochastic Quantizers for Privacy Preservation,Systems and Control (eess.SY); Cryptography and Security (cs.CR),"Le Liu, Yu Kawano, Ming Cao","Abstract:In this paper, we examine the role of stochastic quantizers for privacy preservation. We first employ a static stochastic quantizer and investigate its corresponding privacy-preserving properties. Specifically, we demonstrate that a sufficiently large quantization step guarantees $(0, \delta)$ differential privacy. Additionally, the degradation of control performance caused by quantization is evaluated as the tracking error of output regulation. These two analyses characterize the trade-off between privacy and control performance, determined by the quantization step. This insight enables us to use quantization intentionally as a means to achieve the seemingly conflicting two goals of maintaining control performance and preserving privacy at the same time; towards this end, we further investigate a dynamic stochastic quantizer. Under a stability assumption, the dynamic stochastic quantizer can enhance privacy, more than the static one, while achieving the same control performance. We further handle the unstable case by additionally applying input Gaussian noise."
The Exchange Problem,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS); Computer Science and Game Theory (cs.GT),"Mohit Garg, Suneel Sarswat","Abstract:Auctions are widely used in exchanges to match buy and sell requests. Once the buyers and sellers place their requests, the exchange determines how these requests are to be matched. The two most popular objectives used while determining the matching are maximizing volume at a uniform price and maximizing volume with dynamic pricing. In this work, we study the algorithmic complexity of the problems arising from these matching tasks.
We present a linear time algorithm for uniform price matching which is an improvement over the previous algorithms that take $O(n\log n)$ time to match $n$ requests. For dynamic price matching, we establish a lower bound of $\Omega(n \log n)$ on the running time, thereby proving that the currently known best algorithm is time-optimal."
Adding Multimodal Capabilities to a Text-only Translation Model,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Vipin Vijayan, Braeden Bowen, Scott Grigsby, Timothy Anderson, Jeremy Gwinnup","Abstract:While most current work in multimodal machine translation (MMT) uses the Multi30k dataset for training and evaluation, we find that the resulting models overfit to the Multi30k dataset to an extreme degree. Consequently, these models perform very badly when evaluated against typical text-only testing sets such as the WMT newstest datasets. In order to perform well on both Multi30k and typical text-only datasets, we use a performant text-only machine translation (MT) model as the starting point of our MMT model. We add vision-text adapter layers connected via gating mechanisms to the MT model, and incrementally transform the MT model into an MMT model by 1) pre-training using vision-based masking of the source text and 2) fine-tuning on Multi30k."
A Backpack Full of Skills: Egocentric Video Understanding with Diverse  Task Perspectives,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Simone Alberto Peirone, Francesca Pistilli, Antonio Alliegro, Giuseppe Averta","Abstract:Human comprehension of a video stream is naturally broad: in a few instants, we are able to understand what is happening, the relevance and relationship of objects, and forecast what will follow in the near future, everything all at once. We believe that - to effectively transfer such an holistic perception to intelligent machines - an important role is played by learning to correlate concepts and to abstract knowledge coming from different tasks, to synergistically exploit them when learning novel skills. To accomplish this, we seek for a unified approach to video understanding which combines shared temporal modelling of human actions with minimal overhead, to support multiple downstream tasks and enable cooperation when learning novel skills. We then propose EgoPack, a solution that creates a collection of task perspectives that can be carried across downstream tasks and used as a potential source of additional insights, as a backpack of skills that a robot can carry around and use when needed. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach on four Ego4D benchmarks, outperforming current state-of-the-art methods."
"Mars 2.0: A Toolchain for Modeling, Analysis, Verification and Code  Generation of Cyber-Physical Systems",Programming Languages (cs.PL),"Bohua Zhan, Xiong Xu, Qiang Gao, Zekun Ji, Xiangyu Jin, Shuling Wang, Naijun Zhan","Abstract:We introduce Mars 2.0 for modeling, analysis, verification and code generation of Cyber-Physical Systems. Mars 2.0 integrates Mars 1.0 with several important extensions and improvements, allowing the design of cyber-physical systems using the combination of AADL and Simulink/Stateflow, which provide a unified graphical framework for modeling the functionality, physicality and architecture of the system to be developed. For a safety-critical system, formal analysis and verification of its combined AADL and Simulink/Stateflow model can be conducted via the following steps. First, the toolchain automatically translates AADL and Simulink/Stateflow models into Hybrid CSP (HCSP), an extension of CSP for formally modeling hybrid systems. Second, the HCSP processes can be simulated using the HCSP simulator, and to complement incomplete simulation, they can be verified using the Hybrid Hoare Logic prover in Isabelle/HOL, as well as the more automated HHLPy prover. Finally, implementations in SystemC or C can be automatically generated from the verified HCSP processes. The transformation from AADL and Simulink/Stateflow to HCSP, and the one from HCSP to SystemC or C, are both guaranteed to be correct with formal proofs. This approach allows model-driven design of safety-critical cyber-physical systems based on graphical and formal models and proven-correct translation procedures. We demonstrate the use of the toolchain on several benchmarks of varying complexity, including several industrial-sized examples."
Logic Programming with Multiplicative Structures,Logic in Computer Science (cs.LO),"Matteo Acclavio, Roberto Maieli","Abstract:In the logic programming paradigm, a program is defined by a set of methods, each of which can be executed when specific conditions are met during the current state of an execution. The semantics of these programs can be elegantly represented using sequent calculi, in which each method is linked to an inference rule. In this context, proof search mirrors the program's execution. Previous works introduced a framework in which the process of constructing proof nets is employed to model executions, as opposed to the traditional approach of proof search in sequent calculus.
This paper further extends this investigation by focussing on the pure multiplicative fragment of this framework. We demonstrate, providing practical examples, the capability to define logic programming methods with context-sensitive behaviors solely through specific resource-preserving and context-free operations, corresponding to certain generalized multiplicative connectives explored in existing literature. We show how some of these methods, although still multiplicative, escape the purely multiplicative fragment of Linear Logic (MLL)."
Learning to Use Tools via Cooperative and Interactive Agents,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Zhengliang Shi, Shen Gao, Xiuyi Chen, Lingyong Yan, Haibo Shi, Dawei Yin, Zhumin Chen, Pengjie Ren, Suzan Verberne, Zhaochun Ren","Abstract:Tool learning empowers large language models (LLMs) as agents to use external tools to extend their capability. Existing methods employ one single LLM-based agent to iteratively select and execute tools, thereafter incorporating the result into the next action prediction. However, they still suffer from potential performance degradation when addressing complex tasks due to: (1) the limitation of the inherent capability of a single LLM to perform diverse actions, and (2) the struggle to adaptively correct mistakes when the task fails. To mitigate these problems, we propose the ConAgents, a Cooperative and interactive Agents framework, which modularizes the workflow of tool learning into Grounding, Execution, and Observing agents. We also introduce an iterative calibration (IterCali) method, enabling the agents to adapt themselves based on the feedback from the tool environment. Experiments conducted on three datasets demonstrate the superiority of our ConAgents (e.g., 6 point improvement over the SOTA baseline). We further provide fine-granularity analysis for the efficiency and consistency of our framework."
Unifying Controller Design for Stabilizing Nonlinear Systems with  Norm-Bounded Control Inputs,Systems and Control (eess.SY); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Optimization and Control (math.OC),"Ming Li, Zhiyong Sun, Siep Weiland","Abstract:This paper revisits a classical challenge in the design of stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems with a norm-bounded input constraint. By extending Lin-Sontag's universal formula and introducing a generic (state-dependent) scaling term, a unifying controller design method is proposed. The incorporation of this generic scaling term gives a unified controller and enables the derivation of alternative universal formulas with various favorable properties, which makes it suitable for tailored control designs to meet specific requirements and provides versatility across different control scenarios. Additionally, we present a constructive approach to determine the optimal scaling term, leading to an explicit solution to an optimization problem, named optimization-based universal formula. The resulting controller ensures asymptotic stability, satisfies a norm-bounded input constraint, and optimizes a predefined cost function. Finally, the essential properties of the unified controllers are analyzed, including smoothness, continuity at the origin, stability margin, and inverse optimality. Simulations validate the approach, showcasing its effectiveness in addressing a challenging stabilizing control problem of a nonlinear system."
Socratic Reasoning Improves Positive Text Rewriting,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Anmol Goel, Nico Daheim, Iryna Gurevych","Abstract:Reframing a negative into a positive thought is at the crux of several cognitive approaches to mental health and psychotherapy that could be made more accessible by large language model-based solutions. Such reframing is typically non-trivial and requires multiple rationalization steps to uncover the underlying issue of a negative thought and transform it to be more positive. However, this rationalization process is currently neglected by both datasets and models which reframe thoughts in one step. In this work, we address this gap by augmenting open-source datasets for positive text rewriting with synthetically-generated Socratic rationales using a novel framework called \textsc{SocraticReframe}. \textsc{SocraticReframe} uses a sequence of question-answer pairs to rationalize the thought rewriting process. We show that such Socratic rationales significantly improve positive text rewriting for different open-source LLMs according to both automatic and human evaluations guided by criteria from psychotherapy research."
Word Importance Explains How Prompts Affect Language Model Outputs,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Stefan Hackmann, Haniyeh Mahmoudian, Mark Steadman, Michael Schmidt","Abstract:The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized numerous applications across industries. However, their ""black box"" nature often hinders the understanding of how they make specific decisions, raising concerns about their transparency, reliability, and ethical use. This study presents a method to improve the explainability of LLMs by varying individual words in prompts to uncover their statistical impact on the model outputs. This approach, inspired by permutation importance for tabular data, masks each word in the system prompt and evaluates its effect on the outputs based on the available text scores aggregated over multiple user inputs. Unlike classical attention, word importance measures the impact of prompt words on arbitrarily-defined text scores, which enables decomposing the importance of words into the specific measures of interest--including bias, reading level, verbosity, etc. This procedure also enables measuring impact when attention weights are not available. To test the fidelity of this approach, we explore the effect of adding different suffixes to multiple different system prompts and comparing subsequent generations with different large language models. Results show that word importance scores are closely related to the expected suffix importances for multiple scoring functions."
Toward Improved Deep Learning-based Vulnerability Detection,Software Engineering (cs.SE),"Adriana Sejfia, Satyaki Das, Saad Shafiq, Nenad Medvidoviƒá","Abstract:Deep learning (DL) has been a common thread across several recent techniques for vulnerability detection. The rise of large, publicly available datasets of vulnerabilities has fueled the learning process underpinning these techniques. While these datasets help the DL-based vulnerability detectors, they also constrain these detectors' predictive abilities. Vulnerabilities in these datasets have to be represented in a certain way, e.g., code lines, functions, or program slices within which the vulnerabilities exist. We refer to this representation as a base unit. The detectors learn how base units can be vulnerable and then predict whether other base units are vulnerable. We have hypothesized that this focus on individual base units harms the ability of the detectors to properly detect those vulnerabilities that span multiple base units (or MBU vulnerabilities). For vulnerabilities such as these, a correct detection occurs when all comprising base units are detected as vulnerable. Verifying how existing techniques perform in detecting all parts of a vulnerability is important to establish their effectiveness for other downstream tasks. To evaluate our hypothesis, we conducted a study focusing on three prominent DL-based detectors: ReVeal, DeepWukong, and LineVul. Our study shows that all three detectors contain MBU vulnerabilities in their respective datasets. Further, we observed significant accuracy drops when detecting these types of vulnerabilities. We present our study and a framework that can be used to help DL-based detectors toward the proper inclusion of MBU vulnerabilities."
Accelerating the convergence of Newton's method for nonlinear elliptic  PDEs using Fourier neural operators,Numerical Analysis (math.NA),"Joubine Aghili, Emmanuel Franck, Romain Hild, Victor Michel-Dansac, Vincent Vigon","Abstract:It is well known that Newton's method, especially when applied to large problems such as the discretization of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs), can have trouble converging if the initial guess is too far from the solution. This work focuses on accelerating this convergence, in the context of the discretization of nonlinear elliptic PDEs. We first provide a quick review of existing methods, and justify our choice of learning an initial guess with a Fourier neural operator (FNO). This choice was motivated by the mesh-independence of such operators, whose training and evaluation can be performed on grids with different resolutions. The FNO is trained using a loss minimization over generated data, loss functions based on the PDE discretization. Numerical results, in one and two dimensions, show that the proposed initial guess accelerates the convergence of Newton's method by a large margin compared to a naive initial guess, especially for highly nonlinear or anisotropic problems."
SplAgger: Split Aggregation for Meta-Reinforcement Learning,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Jacob Beck, Matthew Jackson, Risto Vuorio, Zheng Xiong, Shimon Whiteson","Abstract:A core ambition of reinforcement learning (RL) is the creation of agents capable of rapid learning in novel tasks. Meta-RL aims to achieve this by directly learning such agents. One category of meta-RL methods, called black box methods, does so by training off-the-shelf sequence models end-to-end. In contrast, another category of methods have been developed that explicitly infer a posterior distribution over the unknown task. These methods generally have distinct objectives and sequence models designed to enable task inference, and so are known as task inference methods. However, recent evidence suggests that task inference objectives are unnecessary in practice. Nonetheless, it remains unclear whether task inference sequence models are beneficial even when task inference objectives are not. In this paper, we present strong evidence that task inference sequence models are still beneficial. In particular, we investigate sequence models with permutation invariant aggregation, which exploit the fact that, due to the Markov property, the task posterior does not depend on the order of data. We empirically confirm the advantage of permutation invariant sequence models without the use of task inference objectives. However, we also find, surprisingly, that there are multiple conditions under which permutation variance remains useful. Therefore, we propose SplAgger, which uses both permutation variant and invariant components to achieve the best of both worlds, outperforming all baselines on continuous control and memory environments."
CRISPR: Ensemble Model,Machine Learning (cs.LG); Genomics (q-bio.GN),"Mohammad Rostami, Amin Ghariyazi, Hamed Dashti, Mohammad Hossein Rohban, Hamid R. Rabiee","Abstract:Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPR) is a gene editing technology that has revolutionized the fields of biology and medicine. However, one of the challenges of using CRISPR is predicting the on-target efficacy and off-target sensitivity of single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). This is because most existing methods are trained on separate datasets with different genes and cells, which limits their generalizability. In this paper, we propose a novel ensemble learning method for sgRNA design that is accurate and generalizable. Our method combines the predictions of multiple machine learning models to produce a single, more robust prediction. This approach allows us to learn from a wider range of data, which improves the generalizability of our model. We evaluated our method on a benchmark dataset of sgRNA designs and found that it outperformed existing methods in terms of both accuracy and generalizability. Our results suggest that our method can be used to design sgRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity, even for new genes or cells. This could have important implications for the clinical use of CRISPR, as it would allow researchers to design more effective and safer treatments for a variety of diseases."
OPEx: A Component-Wise Analysis of LLM-Centric Agents in Embodied  Instruction Following,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Haochen Shi, Zhiyuan Sun, Xingdi Yuan, Marc-Alexandre C√¥t√©, Bang Liu","Abstract:Embodied Instruction Following (EIF) is a crucial task in embodied learning, requiring agents to interact with their environment through egocentric observations to fulfill natural language instructions. Recent advancements have seen a surge in employing large language models (LLMs) within a framework-centric approach to enhance performance in embodied learning tasks, including EIF. Despite these efforts, there exists a lack of a unified understanding regarding the impact of various components-ranging from visual perception to action execution-on task performance. To address this gap, we introduce OPEx, a comprehensive framework that delineates the core components essential for solving embodied learning tasks: Observer, Planner, and Executor. Through extensive evaluations, we provide a deep analysis of how each component influences EIF task performance. Furthermore, we innovate within this space by deploying a multi-agent dialogue strategy on a TextWorld counterpart, further enhancing task performance. Our findings reveal that LLM-centric design markedly improves EIF outcomes, identify visual perception and low-level action execution as critical bottlenecks, and demonstrate that augmenting LLMs with a multi-agent framework further elevates performance."
Low Complexity Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted THz Systems with Beam  Split,Information Theory (cs.IT); Signal Processing (eess.SP),"Xin Su, Ruisi He, Peng Zhang, Bo Ai","Abstract:To support extremely high data rates, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted terahertz (THz) communication is considered to be a promising technology for future sixth-generation networks. However, due to the typical employment of hybrid beamforming architecture in THz systems, as well as the passive nature of RIS which lacks the capability to process pilot signals, obtaining channel state information (CSI) is facing significant challenges. To accurately estimate the cascaded channel, we propose a novel low-complexity channel estimation scheme, which includes three steps. Specifically, we first estimate full CSI within a small subset of subcarriers (SCs). Then, we acquire angular information at base station and RIS based on the full CSI. Finally, we derive spatial directions and recover full-CSI for the remaining SCs. Theoretical analysis and simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme can achieve superior performance in terms of normalized mean-square-error and exhibit a lower computational complexity compared with the existing algorithms."
The Case for Evaluating Multimodal Translation Models on Text Datasets,Computation and Language (cs.CL),"Vipin Vijayan, Braeden Bowen, Scott Grigsby, Timothy Anderson, Jeremy Gwinnup","Abstract:A good evaluation framework should evaluate multimodal machine translation (MMT) models by measuring 1) their use of visual information to aid in the translation task and 2) their ability to translate complex sentences such as done for text-only machine translation. However, most current work in MMT is evaluated against the Multi30k testing sets, which do not measure these properties. Namely, the use of visual information by the MMT model cannot be shown directly from the Multi30k test set results and the sentences in Multi30k are are image captions, i.e., short, descriptive sentences, as opposed to complex sentences that typical text-only machine translation models are evaluated against.
Therefore, we propose that MMT models be evaluated using 1) the CoMMuTE evaluation framework, which measures the use of visual information by MMT models, 2) the text-only WMT news translation task test sets, which evaluates translation performance against complex sentences, and 3) the Multi30k test sets, for measuring MMT model performance against a real MMT dataset. Finally, we evaluate recent MMT models trained solely against the Multi30k dataset against our proposed evaluation framework and demonstrate the dramatic drop performance against text-only testing sets compared to recent text-only MT models."
Knowledge Graphs as Context Sources for LLM-Based Explanations of  Learning Recommendations,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Hasan Abu-Rasheed, Christian Weber, Madjid Fathi","Abstract:In the era of personalized education, the provision of comprehensible explanations for learning recommendations is of a great value to enhance the learner's understanding and engagement with the recommended learning content. Large language models (LLMs) and generative AI in general have recently opened new doors for generating human-like explanations, for and along learning recommendations. However, their precision is still far away from acceptable in a sensitive field like education. To harness the abilities of LLMs, while still ensuring a high level of precision towards the intent of the learners, this paper proposes an approach to utilize knowledge graphs (KG) as a source of factual context, for LLM prompts, reducing the risk of model hallucinations, and safeguarding against wrong or imprecise information, while maintaining an application-intended learning context. We utilize the semantic relations in the knowledge graph to offer curated knowledge about learning recommendations. With domain-experts in the loop, we design the explanation as a textual template, which is filled and completed by the LLM. Domain experts were integrated in the prompt engineering phase as part of a study, to ensure that explanations include information that is relevant to the learner. We evaluate our approach quantitatively using Rouge-N and Rouge-L measures, as well as qualitatively with experts and learners. Our results show an enhanced recall and precision of the generated explanations compared to those generated solely by the GPT model, with a greatly reduced risk of generating imprecise information in the final learning explanation."
Implicit-Explicit simulation of Mass-Spring-Charge Systems,Graphics (cs.GR),"Zhiyuan Zhang, Zhaocheng Liu, Stefanos Papanicolopulos, Kartic Subr","Abstract:Point masses connected by springs, or mass-spring systems, are widely used in computer animation to approximate the behavior of deformable objects. One of the restrictions imposed by these models is that points that are not topologically constrained (linked by a spring) are unable to interact with each other explicitly. Such interactions would introduce a new dimension for artistic control and animation within the computer graphics community. Beyond graphics, such a model could be an effective proxy to use for model-based learning of complex physical systems such as molecular biology. We propose to imbue masses in a mass-spring system with electrostatic charge leading a system with internal forces between all pairs of charged points -- regardless of whether they are linked by a spring. We provide a practical and stable algorithm to simulate charged mass-spring systems over long time horizons. We demonstrate how these systems may be controlled via parameters such as guidance electric fields or external charges, thus presenting fresh opportunities for artistic authoring. Our method is especially appropriate for computer graphics applications due to its robustness at larger simulation time steps."
Feast Your Eyes: Mixture-of-Resolution Adaptation for Multimodal Large  Language Models,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Gen Luo, Yiyi Zhou, Yuxin Zhang, Xiawu Zheng, Xiaoshuai Sun, Rongrong Ji","Abstract:Despite remarkable progress, existing multimodal large language models (MLLMs) are still inferior in granular visual recognition. Contrary to previous works, we study this problem from the perspective of image resolution, and reveal that a combination of low- and high-resolution visual features can effectively mitigate this shortcoming. Based on this observation, we propose a novel and efficient method for MLLMs, termed Mixture-of-Resolution Adaptation (MRA). In particular, MRA adopts two visual pathways for images with different resolutions, where high-resolution visual information is embedded into the low-resolution pathway via the novel mixture-of-resolution adapters (MR-Adapters). This design also greatly reduces the input sequence length of MLLMs. To validate MRA, we apply it to a recent MLLM called LLaVA, and term the new model LLaVA-HR. We conduct extensive experiments on 11 vision-language (VL) tasks, which show that LLaVA-HR outperforms existing MLLMs on 8 VL tasks, e.g., +9.4% on TextVQA. More importantly, both training and inference of LLaVA-HR remain efficient with MRA, e.g., 20 training hours and 3$\times$ inference speed than LLaVA-1.5.

Towards Calibrated Deep Clustering Network,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Yuheng Jia, Jianhong Cheng, Hui Liu, Junhui Hou","Abstract:Deep clustering has exhibited remarkable performance; however, the overconfidence problem, i.e., the estimated confidence for a sample belonging to a particular cluster greatly exceeds its actual prediction accuracy, has been overlooked in prior research. To tackle this critical issue, we pioneer the development of a calibrated deep clustering framework. Specifically, we propose a novel dual-head deep clustering pipeline that can effectively calibrate the estimated confidence and the actual accuracy. The calibration head adjusts the overconfident predictions of the clustering head using regularization methods, generating prediction confidence and pseudo-labels that match the model learning status. This calibration process also guides the clustering head in dynamically selecting reliable high-confidence samples for training. Additionally, we introduce an effective network initialization strategy that enhances both training speed and network robustness. Extensive experiments demonstrate the proposed calibrated deep clustering framework not only surpasses state-of-the-art deep clustering methods by approximately 10 times in terms of expected calibration error but also significantly outperforms them in terms of clustering accuracy."
Cover Edge-Based Novel Triangle Counting,Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),"David A. Bader, Fuhuan Li, Zhihui Du, Palina Pauliuchenka, Oliver Alvarado Rodriguez, Anant Gupta, Sai Sri Vastav Minnal, Valmik Nahata, Anya Ganeshan, Ahmet Gundogdu, Jason Lew","Abstract:Listing and counting triangles in graphs is a key algorithmic kernel for network analyses, including community detection, clustering coefficients, k-trusses, and triangle centrality. In this paper, we propose the novel concept of a cover-edge set that can be used to find triangles more efficiently. Leveraging the breadth-first search (BFS) method, we can quickly generate a compact cover-edge set. Novel sequential and parallel triangle counting algorithms that employ cover-edge sets are presented. The novel sequential algorithm performs competitively with the fastest previous approaches on both real and synthetic graphs, such as those from the Graph500 Benchmark and the MIT/Amazon/IEEE Graph Challenge. We implement 22 sequential algorithms for performance evaluation and comparison. At the same time, we employ OpenMP to parallelize 11 sequential algorithms, presenting an in-depth analysis of their parallel performance. Furthermore, we develop a distributed parallel algorithm that can asymptotically reduce communication on massive graphs. In our estimate from massive-scale Graph500 graphs, our distributed parallel algorithm can reduce the communication on a scale~36 graph by 1156x and on a scale~42 graph by 2368x. Comprehensive experiments are conducted on the recently launched Intel Xeon 8480+ processor and shed light on how graph attributes, such as topology, diameter, and degree distribution, can affect the performance of these algorithms."
A Convex Optimization Framework for Computing Robustness Margins of  Kalman Filters,Systems and Control (eess.SY); Optimization and Control (math.OC); Applications (stat.AP),"Himanshu Prabhat, Raktim Bhattacharya",Abstract:This paper proposes a novel convex optimization framework for designing robust Kalman filters that guarantee a user-specified steady-state error while maximizing process and sensor noise. The proposed framework simultaneously determines the Kalman gain and the robustness margin in terms of the process and sensor noise. This is the first paper to present such a joint formulation for Kalman filtering. The proposed methodology is validated through two distinct examples: the Clohessy-Wiltshire-Hill equations for a chaser spacecraft in an elliptical orbit and the longitudinal motion model of an F-16 aircraft.
Mitigating Label Flipping Attacks in Malicious URL Detectors Using  Ensemble Trees,Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),"Ehsan Nowroozi, Nada Jadalla, Samaneh Ghelichkhani, Alireza Jolfaei","Abstract:Malicious URLs provide adversarial opportunities across various industries, including transportation, healthcare, energy, and banking which could be detrimental to business operations. Consequently, the detection of these URLs is of crucial importance; however, current Machine Learning (ML) models are susceptible to backdoor attacks. These attacks involve manipulating a small percentage of training data labels, such as Label Flipping (LF), which changes benign labels to malicious ones and vice versa. This manipulation results in misclassification and leads to incorrect model behavior. Therefore, integrating defense mechanisms into the architecture of ML models becomes an imperative consideration to fortify against potential attacks.
The focus of this study is on backdoor attacks in the context of URL detection using ensemble trees. By illuminating the motivations behind such attacks, highlighting the roles of attackers, and emphasizing the critical importance of effective defense strategies, this paper contributes to the ongoing efforts to fortify ML models against adversarial threats within the ML domain in network security. We propose an innovative alarm system that detects the presence of poisoned labels and a defense mechanism designed to uncover the original class labels with the aim of mitigating backdoor attacks on ensemble tree classifiers. We conducted a case study using the Alexa and Phishing Site URL datasets and showed that LF attacks can be addressed using our proposed defense mechanism. Our experimental results prove that the LF attack achieved an Attack Success Rate (ASR) between 50-65% within 2-5%, and the innovative defense method successfully detected poisoned labels with an accuracy of up to 100%."
Localized Zeroth-Order Prompt Optimization,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Wenyang Hu, Yao Shu, Zongmin Yu, Zhaoxuan Wu, Xiangqiang Lin, Zhongxiang Dai, See-Kiong Ng, Bryan Kian Hsiang Low","Abstract:The efficacy of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and generating natural language has aroused a wide interest in developing prompt-based methods to harness the power of black-box LLMs. Existing methodologies usually prioritize a global optimization for finding the global optimum, which however will perform poorly in certain tasks. This thus motivates us to re-think the necessity of finding a global optimum in prompt optimization. To answer this, we conduct a thorough empirical study on prompt optimization and draw two major insights. Contrasting with the rarity of global optimum, local optima are usually prevalent and well-performed, which can be more worthwhile for efficient prompt optimization (Insight I). The choice of the input domain, covering both the generation and the representation of prompts, affects the identification of well-performing local optima (Insight II). Inspired by these insights, we propose a novel algorithm, namely localized zeroth-order prompt optimization (ZOPO), which incorporates a Neural Tangent Kernel-based derived Gaussian process into standard zeroth-order optimization for an efficient search of well-performing local optima in prompt optimization. Remarkably, ZOPO outperforms existing baselines in terms of both the optimization performance and the query efficiency, which we demonstrate through extensive experiments."
MADTP: Multimodal Alignment-Guided Dynamic Token Pruning for  Accelerating Vision-Language Transformer,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Jianjian Cao, Peng Ye, Shengze Li, Chong Yu, Yansong Tang, Jiwen Lu, Tao Chen","Abstract:Vision-Language Transformers (VLTs) have shown great success recently, but are meanwhile accompanied by heavy computation costs, where a major reason can be attributed to the large number of visual and language tokens. Existing token pruning research for compressing VLTs mainly follows a single-modality-based scheme yet ignores the critical role of aligning different modalities for guiding the token pruning process, causing the important tokens for one modality to be falsely pruned in another modality branch. Meanwhile, existing VLT pruning works also lack the flexibility to dynamically compress each layer based on different input samples. To this end, we propose a novel framework named Multimodal Alignment-Guided Dynamic Token Pruning (MADTP) for accelerating various VLTs. Specifically, we first introduce a well-designed Multi-modality Alignment Guidance (MAG) module that can align features of the same semantic concept from different modalities, to ensure the pruned tokens are less important for all modalities. We further design a novel Dynamic Token Pruning (DTP) module, which can adaptively adjust the token compression ratio in each layer based on different input instances. Extensive experiments on various benchmarks demonstrate that MADTP significantly reduces the computational complexity of kinds of multimodal models while preserving competitive performance. Notably, when applied to the BLIP model in the NLVR2 dataset, MADTP can reduce the GFLOPs by 80% with less than 4% performance degradation."

Evolution Transformer: In-Context Evolutionary Optimization,Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Neural and Evolutionary Computing (cs.NE),"Robert Tjarko Lange, Yingtao Tian, Yujin Tang","Abstract:Evolutionary optimization algorithms are often derived from loose biological analogies and struggle to leverage information obtained during the sequential course of optimization. An alternative promising approach is to leverage data and directly discover powerful optimization principles via meta-optimization. In this work, we follow such a paradigm and introduce Evolution Transformer, a causal Transformer architecture, which can flexibly characterize a family of Evolution Strategies. Given a trajectory of evaluations and search distribution statistics, Evolution Transformer outputs a performance-improving update to the search distribution. The architecture imposes a set of suitable inductive biases, i.e. the invariance of the distribution update to the order of population members within a generation and equivariance to the order of the search dimensions. We train the model weights using Evolutionary Algorithm Distillation, a technique for supervised optimization of sequence models using teacher algorithm trajectories. The resulting model exhibits strong in-context optimization performance and shows strong generalization capabilities to otherwise challenging neuroevolution tasks. We analyze the resulting properties of the Evolution Transformer and propose a technique to fully self-referentially train the Evolution Transformer, starting from a random initialization and bootstrapping its own learning progress. We provide an open source implementation under this https URL."
Federated Learning Under Attack: Exposing Vulnerabilities through Data  Poisoning Attacks in Computer Networks,Cryptography and Security (cs.CR); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Computers and Society (cs.CY); Machine Learning (cs.LG); Networking and Internet Architecture (cs.NI),"Ehsan Nowroozi, Imran Haider, Rahim Taheri, Mauro Conti","Abstract:Federated Learning (FL) is a machine learning (ML) approach that enables multiple decentralized devices or edge servers to collaboratively train a shared model without exchanging raw data. During the training and sharing of model updates between clients and servers, data and models are susceptible to different data-poisoning attacks.
In this study, our motivation is to explore the severity of data poisoning attacks in the computer network domain because they are easy to implement but difficult to detect. We considered two types of data-poisoning attacks, label flipping (LF) and feature poisoning (FP), and applied them with a novel approach. In LF, we randomly flipped the labels of benign data and trained the model on the manipulated data. For FP, we randomly manipulated the highly contributing features determined using the Random Forest algorithm. The datasets used in this experiment were CIC and UNSW related to computer networks. We generated adversarial samples using the two attacks mentioned above, which were applied to a small percentage of datasets. Subsequently, we trained and tested the accuracy of the model on adversarial datasets. We recorded the results for both benign and manipulated datasets and observed significant differences between the accuracy of the models on different datasets. From the experimental results, it is evident that the LF attack failed, whereas the FP attack showed effective results, which proved its significance in fooling a server. With a 1% LF attack on the CIC, the accuracy was approximately 0.0428 and the ASR was 0.9564; hence, the attack is easily detectable, while with a 1% FP attack, the accuracy and ASR were both approximately 0.9600, hence, FP attacks are difficult to detect. We repeated the experiment with different poisoning percentages."
Doubly Abductive Counterfactual Inference for Text-based Image Editing,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Xue Song, Jiequan Cui, Hanwang Zhang, Jingjing Chen, Richang Hong, Yu-Gang Jiang","Abstract:We study text-based image editing (TBIE) of a single image by counterfactual inference because it is an elegant formulation to precisely address the requirement: the edited image should retain the fidelity of the original one. Through the lens of the formulation, we find that the crux of TBIE is that existing techniques hardly achieve a good trade-off between editability and fidelity, mainly due to the overfitting of the single-image fine-tuning. To this end, we propose a Doubly Abductive Counterfactual inference framework (DAC). We first parameterize an exogenous variable as a UNet LoRA, whose abduction can encode all the image details. Second, we abduct another exogenous variable parameterized by a text encoder LoRA, which recovers the lost editability caused by the overfitted first abduction. Thanks to the second abduction, which exclusively encodes the visual transition from post-edit to pre-edit, its inversion -- subtracting the LoRA -- effectively reverts pre-edit back to post-edit, thereby accomplishing the edit. Through extensive experiments, our DAC achieves a good trade-off between editability and fidelity. Thus, we can support a wide spectrum of user editing intents, including addition, removal, manipulation, replacement, style transfer, and facial change, which are extensively validated in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations.

Fast Iterative Region Inflation for Computing Large 2-D/3-D Convex  Regions of Obstacle-Free Space,Robotics (cs.RO),"Qianhao Wang, Zhepei Wang, Chao Xu, Fei Gao","Abstract:1) Restrictive Inflation is designed to ensure the managibility of the generated convex polytope. Based on its characteristic of few variables but rich constraints, an efficient and numerically stable solver is designed. 2) A novel method that formulates the MVIE problem into SOCP formulation is proposed, which avoids directly confronting the positive definite constraints and improves the computational efficiency. 3) Especially for 2-D MVIE, a linear-time exact algorithm is introduced for the first time, filling a gap that existed for several decades and further enabling ultra-fast computational performance. 4) Building upon the above methods, a reliable convex polytope generation algorithm FIRI is proposed.

High-performance implementation of FIRI will be open-sourced for the reference of the community."
A General and Flexible Multi-concept Parsing Framework for Multilingual  Semantic Matching,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI),"Dong Yao, Asaad Alghamdi, Qingrong Xia, Xiaoye Qu, Xinyu Duan, Zhefeng Wang, Yi Zheng, Baoxing Huai, Peilun Cheng, Zhou Zhao","Abstract:Sentence semantic matching is a research hotspot in natural language processing, which is considerably significant in various key scenarios, such as community question answering, searching, chatbot, and recommendation. Since most of the advanced models directly model the semantic relevance among words between two sentences while neglecting the \textit{keywords} and \textit{intents} concepts of them, DC-Match is proposed to disentangle keywords from intents and utilizes them to optimize the matching performance. Although DC-Match is a simple yet effective method for semantic matching, it highly depends on the external NER techniques to identify the keywords of sentences, which limits the performance of semantic matching for minor languages since satisfactory NER tools are usually hard to obtain. In this paper, we propose to generally and flexibly resolve the text into multi concepts for multilingual semantic matching to liberate the model from the reliance on NER models. To this end, we devise a \underline{M}ulti-\underline{C}oncept \underline{P}arsed \underline{S}emantic \underline{M}atching framework based on the pre-trained language models, abbreviated as \textbf{MCP-SM}, to extract various concepts and infuse them into the classification tokens. We conduct comprehensive experiments on English datasets QQP and MRPC, and Chinese dataset Medical-SM. Besides, we experiment on Arabic datasets MQ2Q and XNLI, the outstanding performance further prove MCP-SM's applicability in low-resource languages."
Online Learning of Human Constraints from Feedback in Shared Autonomy,Robotics (cs.RO); Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Shibei Zhu, Tran Nguyen Le, Samuel Kaski, Ville Kyrki","Abstract:Real-time collaboration with humans poses challenges due to the different behavior patterns of humans resulting from diverse physical constraints. Existing works typically focus on learning safety constraints for collaboration, or how to divide and distribute the subtasks between the participating agents to carry out the main task. In contrast, we propose to learn a human constraints model that, in addition, considers the diverse behaviors of different human operators. We consider a type of collaboration in a shared-autonomy fashion, where both a human operator and an assistive robot act simultaneously in the same task space that affects each other's actions. The task of the assistive agent is to augment the skill of humans to perform a shared task by supporting humans as much as possible, both in terms of reducing the workload and minimizing the discomfort for the human operator. Therefore, we propose an augmentative assistant agent capable of learning and adapting to human physical constraints, aligning its actions with the ergonomic preferences and limitations of the human operator."
Bodioid: philosophical reflections on the hybrid of bodies and artefacts  towards post-human,Human-Computer Interaction (cs.HC); Computers and Society (cs.CY),"Jiang Xu (1), Gang Sun (1), Jingyu Xu (1), Pujie Su (1) ((1) Tongji University, College of Design and Innovation, Shanghai, China.)","Abstract:The advent of the post-human era has blurred the boundary between the body and artifacts. Further, external materials and information are more deeply integrated into the body, making emerging technology a key driving force for shaping post-human existence and promoting bodily evolution. Based on this, this study analyses the transformation process of three technological forms, namely tools, machines, and cyborgs, and reveals the construction of bodies and artifacts. From the phenomenological perspective, the essences of body and artifact existences are reflected upon, and the existence is construction viewpoint is proposed. Furthermore, a technological design concept, bodioid, is proposed to meticulously depict the characteristics of integrating similarities and differences towards unity between the body and artifacts, based on the theoretical foundation of technology mediation and the materialization of morality. Finally, through analogizing the organizational form of language, the two key forms and specific mechanisms of bodioid construction, namely extension and mirroring, are indicated. With this in mind, the post-human existence landscape is discussed with the objective of providing theoretical insights into the study of the underlying philosophical principles of technological design."
Space Complexity of Euclidean Clustering,Computational Geometry (cs.CG); Data Structures and Algorithms (cs.DS),"Xiaoyi Zhu, Yuxiang Tian, Lingxiao Huang, Zengfeng Huang","Abstract:The $(k, z)$-Clustering problem in Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^d$ has been extensively studied. Given the scale of data involved, compression methods for the Euclidean $(k, z)$-Clustering problem, such as data compression and dimension reduction, have received significant attention in the literature. However, the space complexity of the clustering problem, specifically, the number of bits required to compress the cost function within a multiplicative error $\varepsilon$, remains unclear in existing literature.
This paper initiates the study of space complexity for Euclidean $(k, z)$-Clustering and offers both upper and lower bounds. Our space bounds are nearly tight when $k$ is constant, indicating that storing a coreset, a well-known data compression approach, serves as the optimal compression scheme. Furthermore, our lower bound result for $(k, z)$-Clustering establishes a tight space bound of $\Theta( n d )$ for terminal embedding, where $n$ represents the dataset size. Our technical approach leverages new geometric insights for principal angles and discrepancy methods, which may hold independent interest."
Multi-modal Instruction Tuned LLMs with Fine-grained Visual Perception,Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV),"Junwen He, Yifan Wang, Lijun Wang, Huchuan Lu, Jun-Yan He, Jin-Peng Lan, Bin Luo, Xuansong Xie","Abstract:Multimodal Large Language Model (MLLMs) leverages Large Language Models as a cognitive framework for diverse visual-language tasks. Recent efforts have been made to equip MLLMs with visual perceiving and grounding capabilities. However, there still remains a gap in providing fine-grained pixel-level perceptions and extending interactions beyond text-specific inputs. In this work, we propose {\bf{AnyRef}}, a general MLLM model that can generate pixel-wise object perceptions and natural language descriptions from multi-modality references, such as texts, boxes, images, or audio. This innovation empowers users with greater flexibility to engage with the model beyond textual and regional prompts, without modality-specific designs. Through our proposed refocusing mechanism, the generated grounding output is guided to better focus on the referenced object, implicitly incorporating additional pixel-level supervision. This simple modification utilizes attention scores generated during the inference of LLM, eliminating the need for extra computations while exhibiting performance enhancements in both grounding masks and referring expressions. With only publicly available training data, our model achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks, including diverse modality referring segmentation and region-level referring expression generation."
Evidence-Focused Fact Summarization for Knowledge-Augmented Zero-Shot  Question Answering,Computation and Language (cs.CL); Artificial Intelligence (cs.AI); Machine Learning (cs.LG),"Sungho Ko, Hyunjin Cho, Hyungjoo Chae, Jinyoung Yeo, Dongha Lee","Abstract:Recent studies have investigated utilizing Knowledge Graphs (KGs) to enhance Quesetion Answering (QA) performance of Large Language Models (LLMs), yet structured KG verbalization remains challengin. Existing methods, such as triple-form or free-form textual conversion of triple-form facts, encounter several issues. These include reduced evidence density due to duplicated entities or relationships, and reduced evidence clarity due to an inability to emphasize crucial evidence. To address these issues, we propose EFSum, an Evidence-focused Fact Summarization framework for enhanced QA with knowledge-augmented LLMs. We optimize an open-source LLM as a fact summarizer through distillation and preference alignment. Our extensive experiments show that EFSum improves LLM's zero-shot QA performance, and it is possible to ensure both the helpfulness and faithfulness of the summary."
